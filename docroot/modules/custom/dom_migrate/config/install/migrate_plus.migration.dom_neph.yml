# A "migration" is, in technical terms, a plugin whose configuration describes
# how to read source data, process it (generally by mapping source fields to
# destination fields), and write it to Drupal.

# The machine name for a migration, used to uniquely identify it.

# Every migration must also have a destination plugin, which handles writing
# the migrated data in the appropriate form for that particular kind of data.
# Most Drupal content is an "entity" of one type or another, and we need to
# specify what entity type we are populating (in this case, taxonomy terms).
# Unlike the source plugin (which is specific to our particular scenario), this
# destination plugin is implemented in Drupal itself.
destination:
  plugin: entity:node

# Here's the meat of the migration - the processing pipeline. This describes how
# each destination field is to be populated based on the source data. For each
# destination field, one or more process plugins may be invoked.

  type:
    plugin: default_value
    default_value: basic_page
  field_page_name: field_title

  body/format:
    plugin: default_value
    default_value: sf_full_html
  status:
    plugin: default_value
    default_value: 0

  # The simplest process plugin is named 'get' - it is the default plugin, so
  # does not need to be explicitly named. It simply copies the source value
  # (the 'style' field from the source database in this case) to the destination
  # field (the taxonomy term 'name' field). You can see we simply copy the
  # source 'details' field to destination 'description' field in the same way.


# Every migration must have a source plugin, which controls the delivery of our
# source data. In this case, our source plugin has the name "beer_term", which
# Drupal resolves to the PHP class defined in
# src/Plugin/migrate/source/BeerTerm.php.

# We'll learn more about dependencies in beer_node - here, we leave them empty.

# By default, configuration entities (like this migration) are not automatically
# removed when the migration which installed them is uninstalled. To have your
# migrations uninstalled with your migration module, add an enforced dependency
# on your module.
