<h4>4. National Sexual Health Survey (NSHS)</h4>
NSHS is national telephone survey of adults 18 years and older residing in the 48 contiguous states.

<h3>Project Accept <a href="/sites/prevention.ucsf.edu/files/uploads/research/portfolio/2009/Morin_S-ProjectAccept2009.pdf">(more here)</a></h3>
Project Accept is an HIV prevention trial in which 34 communities in Africa (in South Africa, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe) and 14 communities in Thailand are being randomized to receive either a community-based HIV voluntary counseling and testing (CBVCT) intervention plus standard clinic-based VCT (SVCT), or SVCT alone. The CBVCT intervention has three major strategies: (1) to make VCT more available in community settings; (2) to engage the community through outreach; and (3) to provide post-test support. These strategies are designed to change community norms and reduce risk for HIV infection among all community members, irrespective of whether they participated directly in the intervention. <em>(posted 7/10)</em>

<h3>Mpowerment project <a href="http://www.mpowerment.org/">(more here)</a></h3>
The Mpowerment Project is a community-level HIV prevention intervention designed to reduce the frequency of unprotected anal intercourse among young gay/bisexual men, ages 18-29, by mobilizing young gay men to support each other about safer sex and to build a stronger, healthier young gay men’s community. It is the only scientifically developed and empirically tested intervention that has been shown to reduce HIV sexual risk taking behaviors among young gay men.

In developing countries where health resources are severely limited, debate continues regarding the relative amount that should be spent on HIV counseling and testing. While HIV counseling and testing has been promoted as effective for prevention, few controlled studies have been conducted.The Voluntary HIV Counseling and Testing Efficacy study was a randomized clinical trial of the effectiveness of HIV counseling and testing for the prevention of new HIV infections. The study was conducted at three sites: Nairobi, Kenya; Dar-Es- Salaam, Tanzania; and Port-of-Spain, Trinidad. <em>(posted 9/98)</em>

		<title>Capacity Building Assistance</title>
		<tax>1736</tax>
		<content><![CDATA[UCSF has a long and successful history of delivering <a href="https://cba.ucsf.edu/">Capacity Building Assistance (CBA)</a> to Community-based Organizations (CBO), going back to the beginning of the epidemic. We provide information dissemination services, training, and technical assistance (TA), including the facilitation of peer-to-peer learning. Our CBA providers are also experienced at helping CBOs use social media in their prevention efforts.

The purpose of our <a href="https://cba.ucsf.edu/">CBA project</a> is to <strong>increase the capacity of the HIV prevention workforce at CBOs to optimize the planning, implementation, and maintenance of interventions and strategies for HIP</strong>. By doing so, UCSF will further the HIV prevention goals and objectives outlined in the <em>National HIV/AIDS Strategy</em>.

Our <a href="https://cba.ucsf.edu/">Capacity Building Assistance (CBA)</a> team includes <strong>expert CBA providers</strong> from UCSF’s Center for AIDS Prevention Studies (CAPS), Center of Excellence for Transgender Health (CoE), and Alliance Health Project (AHP—formerly AIDS Health Project). Additionally, we collaborate with the Bridging Group.

We have the experience and expertise to provide HIP-related CBA services to CBOs to <strong>improve their capacity to conduct HIV testing, prevention with HIV-positive individuals, and prevention with high-risk HIV-negative individuals</strong>, especially:
<ul>
 	<li>Gay/bisexual/and other men who have sex with men</li>
 	<li>Transgender women</li>
 	<li>Communities of color</li>
 	<li>Incarcerated populations</li>
 	<li>Injection drug users</li>
</ul>
While we can assist CBOs implementing and adapting a broad variety of evidence-based HIV prevention approaches, our team has <strong>specialized expertise</strong> on the following interventions and public health strategies:

 	<li>Personalized Cognitive Counseling (PCC)</li>

		<title>International Traineeships in AIDS Prevention Studies</title>
		<tax>1736</tax>
		<content><![CDATA[The International Traineeships in AIDS Prevention Studies (I-TAPS) program, funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, Fogarty International Center, and private donors, has been training scientists from low- and middle-income countries in AIDS prevention research since 1988. Each year, 10 to 12 applicants are selected to train with UCSF scientists at CAPS and Global Health Sciences (GHS). During the six-week intensive short course, each visiting scientist develops a protocol for a specific AIDS prevention–related research project to be carried out in his or her home country. Upon completion of data collection, the trainee may return to UCSF for a course in scientific writing, during which data analysis is completed and a manuscript is written for submission to the peer-reviewed literature.

<h3>AIDS Prevention Studies Fellowships</h3>
The Traineeships in AIDS Prevention Studies (TAPS) program trains scientists for academic and public health careers. We invite applications for two- and three-year postdoctoral fellowships in studies relating to the prevention of AIDS. Offered through the UCSF Department of Medicine, TAPS is located at the Center for AIDS Prevention Studies (CAPS), which is itself part of the Division of Prevention Science within the Department of Medicine. Candidates must hold a PhD, MD, or equivalent doctorate degree. The program is suitable for those who are currently completing their doctoral, residency, or clinical fellowship programs as well as for those who have recently completed their doctoral degrees and seek careers as independent researchers.

<a href="https://prevention.ucsf.edu/about/">CAPS</a>, with its unique combination of institutional resources and access to groundbreaking and state-of-the-art HIV research and researchers of world renown across numerous disciplines, provides an excellent environment for postdoctoral training. More than 80 AIDS-related research projects now being implemented by CAPS investigators will provide a wide variety of opportunities for participation by TAPS fellows.

To accomplish its goal, CAPS offers fellows supplementary academic preparation in research methods, public health, AIDS, and other specific learning objectives and gives closely supervised experiences in AIDS prevention research. Fellows who already have a master of public health (MPH) degree or its equivalent may complete the program in two years; those who do not will be required to complete the <a href="http://sph.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MPH degree at UC Berkeley</a> in the first year, followed by two years of research training.

At the end of the training program each fellow will have accomplished the following:
<ul>
 	<li>completed an MPH degree or equivalent;</li>
 	<li>taken advanced courses in research methods, statistics, and other topics relevant to the fellow’s major fields of interest;</li>
 	<li>participated in and led numerous seminars on research topics within CAPS and in the formal teaching programs of the university;</li>
 	<li>designed several research protocols and completed at least one significant research project under the direction of a faculty mentor;</li>
 	<li>made presentations at national or international meetings;</li>
 	<li>submitted several papers for publication; and</li>
 	<li>prepared at least one research grant proposal for submission.</li>
</ul>
All recipients of NIH research fellowships must sign an agreement with the NIH that they will fulfill a “service payback” commitment in return for their postdoctoral support. Under the provisions of this commitment, postdoctoral fellows in the first 12 months of their training program will incur an obligation which can be satisfied by an additional 12 months of NIH-supported research training or an equal number of months of health-related research or teaching. Individuals completing two years of postdoctoral support have no further service obligations stemming from postdoctoral support. Trainees who complete less than two years of training may be liable for a financial payback obligation for part or all NIH-funded training.
<h3>Fellowship Support</h3>
Each TAPS fellow will be provided with training-related support including a computer, travel to at least one annual professional meeting, health insurance, and other support as required to make the training experience productive. Stipends are based on years of relevant postdoctoral experience and follow the NIH stipend scale for Institutional Research Training Grants. The costs of the master’s degree and required courses will also be covered by the fellowship. Unless other arrangements are more suitable, all fellows will use the modern and fully equipped office facilities occupied by CAPS in downtown San Francisco.
<h3>Application Process</h3>
The fellowship program starts on <strong>July 1</strong> of each year. Applications should be submitted, at the latest, by <strong>December 1</strong>; an application decision will be announced by the following March. Persons interested in this program may request an application package at any time. The master of public health degree program requires a separate application, due <strong>December 1</strong>. Applicants may obtain information regarding the MPH program at the Berkeley campus of the University of California by calling the School of Public Health at (510)643-0881, or by writing to <a title="[GMCP] Compose a new mail to sphinfo@socrates.berkeley.edu" href="mailto:sphinfo@socrates.berkeley.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sphinfo@socrates.berkeley.edu</a>. Applicants can also find information about UCB School of Public Health admissions at <a href="http://sph.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sph.berkeley.edu</a>.
<h3>Eligibility</h3>
To be eligible for the fellowship, applicants must hold a PhD, MD, or equivalent degree and must be an American citizen, a non-citizen national of the U.S. (e.g., from American Samoa), or have been lawfully admitted to the U.S. for permanent residence and have an Alien Registration Receipt Card (I-151 or I-551). The most important selection criteria will be evidence of superior qualifications and productivity, demonstrated interest in AIDS prevention research, and career goals that can clearly benefit from the fellowship program. Minority candidates are strongly encouraged to apply.

		<content><![CDATA[<strong><a title="Cochrane Review Group on HIV/AIDS" href="http://hiv.cochrane.org/">Cochrane Review Group on HIV/AIDS</a></strong> is affiliated with <a title="UCSF Global Health Sciences" href="http://globalhealthsciences.ucsf.edu/">UCSF Global Health Sciences</a> and the <a title="AIDS Research Institute at UCSF" href="http://ari.ucsf.edu/">AIDS Research Institute at UCSF</a>.

The Cochrane HIV/AIDS Group is one of more than 50 Collaborative Review Groups of the <a href="http://www.cochrane.org/">Cochrane Collaboration</a>. Established in 1992, the Cochrane Collaboration is an international network of health care professionals, researchers, and consumers committed to developing and maintaining comprehensive, regularly updated systematic reviews of health care interventions in a given medical specialty. These are published online in <a href="http://www.thecochranelibrary.com/">The Cochrane Library</a>.

The Cochrane HIV/AIDS Group, established in 1997, works with researchers from around the world to prepare and update rigorous systematic reviews of HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care interventions. In a field evolving as rapidly as HIV/AIDS, the best evidence for treatment and prevention decisions may not always be clear. This is especially true in resource-constrained settings. Cochrane systematic reviews on HIV/AIDS topics assist clinicians, public health practitioners, policy makers, and consumers in making evidence-based decisions about HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, and provide direct translation of cutting-edge research into practice.

		<content><![CDATA[<h3>Prepared by the CAPS Community Advisory Board</h3>
<h4>Why Dissemination Recommendations?<a href="/sites/prevention.ucsf.edu/files/uploads/old-site/uploads/2011/02/Recommendations-for-Research-Dissemination-BROCHURE-Spring-2013.pdf"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2712" src="/sites/prevention.ucsf.edu/files/uploads/2016/10/CAB-RecommendatiSpring-2013-cover2.jpg" alt="CAB Recommendations for Research Dissemination" width="189" height="314" /></a></h4>
HIV research, no matter how innovative, will never make a difference in the epidemic unless it is disseminated in an appropriate and timely manner to the people and organizations providing HIV services. Yet many researchers are not trained, rewarded or supported to disseminate research findings beyond academic journals.The <a href="https://prevention.ucsf.edu/about/community-advisory-board/">CAPS Community Advisory Board (CAB)</a> has encouraged and guided CAPS researchers in expanding their dissemination efforts to better reach CBOs, policymakers and community stakeholders. The CAPS CAB drew from their own experiences and interviewed researchers and CBOs to develop “Recommendations for Research Dissemination.”

The PRC aims to:
<ol>
 	<li>Establish a Prevention Research Center that focuses on appropriate adaptation, dissemination and implementation of HIV health disparities research for application to policy, programs and practices;</li>
 	<li>Enhance collaborations with partners in the community, health care systems, government agencies, institutions and universities to facilitate innovative, high-impact, multidisciplinary HIV research and knowledge translation to training, programs, practices and policies;</li>
 	<li>Increase the capacity of partners in the community, health care systems, government agencies, institutions and universities to understand and implement the findings from HIV research through targeted training, communication and dissemination; and</li>
 	<li>Develop an implementation research portfolio that translates and adapts an evidence-based intervention into practice settings. We propose to begin this portfolio by studying the implementation of an evaluated intervention to improve linkage of HIV-infected young Black MSM to clinical care.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Project</h3>
The UCSF PRC is led by Director and Principal Investigator (PI) <a href="https://prevention.ucsf.edu/people/mlightfoot/">Marguerita Lightfoot, PhD</a> and Co-PIs <a href="https://prevention.ucsf.edu/people/grutherford/">George Rutherford, MD</a>, <a href="https://prevention.ucsf.edu/people/grebchook/">Greg Rebchook, PhD</a>, and <a href="https://prevention.ucsf.edu/people/janet-myers-phd-mph/">Janet Myers, PhD, MPH</a>. The PRC leadership team is responsible for PRC operations, which include engaging faculty, community, and public health partners in the activities of the UCSF PRC.

<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2729" src="/sites/prevention.ucsf.edu/files/uploads/2016/10/PRC-Org-chart-500x375.png" alt="UCSF PRC Organization Chart" width="500" height="375" />

The UCSF PRC facilitates significant and innovative health sciences research through partnerships with public health organizations which ultimately improves public health. The PRC has 2 major activities –
<ul>
 	<li><b><strong>The Center Core</strong></b> fosters scientific interaction, stimulates innovation, and enhances the quality of research.</li>
 	<li><a href="https://prevention.ucsf.edu/about/prc-projects/"><b><strong>The Research Core</strong></b></a> functions as an interdependent network of community, academic, and public health partners to conduct prevention research and promote the wide use of practices proven to promote good health.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Center Core</h3>
PRC works with communities to develop, evaluate, and implement varied community research that can prevent and control chronic diseases, identify gaps in research, and translate research results into policy and public health practice. The PRC Core is engaged in five primary activities.
<ul>
 	<li><b><strong>Community Engagement, Partnerships, and Technical Assistance </strong></b>-  PRC facilitates the formation of strong partnerships and collaboration between scientists and community groups, which is broadly defined to include service providers, health care providers, CBOs, public health departments, government agencies, policy makers, gatekeepers, and both infected and affected populations. Technical Assistance (TA) on diverse topics is provided to a variety of CBOs and Health Departments to strengthen their capacity. PRC responds to requests for information about HIV prevention science methods, instruments, research findings, and intervention models.</li>
 	<li><b><strong>Communications and Dissemination</strong></b> – PRC communication strategies are developed thru strong community collaborations. The objectives of the communication plan are to enable dissemination of PRC activities and results to both lay and scientific audiences at the local, state, and national levels as well as national organization. Findings from evidence-based interventions are synthesized and shared with target audiences via determined channels, such as the CAPS/PRC website and social media.</li>
 	<li><b><strong>Evaluation</strong></b> – The PRC has established procedures to collect outcome and process data in order to document PRC activities and demonstrate their impact. This evaluation is also used to identify activities that should be modified to increase impact, productivity and quality.</li>
 	<li>Infrastructure – PRC leadership maintains bidirectional communication between the University administrations and public health, CBO, and community partners. This ensures that the PRC’s mission and goals are understood by its collaborators in order to mobilize support for its activities and research.</li>
 	<li><b><strong>Training</strong></b> – PRC engages in education and training of clinicians, CBOs, public health partners, and community members through workshops and seminars. Building skills to better implement evidence-based strategies is integral to the development and evaluation of many HIV prevention evidence-based interventions and adaptations of these interventions. The PRC team has extensive expertise in both developing and evaluating evidence-based interventions, as well as in adapting them for ethnic/racial and sexual minority groups and implementing them in real-world settings.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Research Core</h3>
<img class="wp-image-5306 alignleft" src="/sites/prevention.ucsf.edu/files/uploads/2016/10/DSC_0317.jpg" alt="" width="380" height="280" /><img class="wp-image-5304 alignleft" src="/sites/prevention.ucsf.edu/files/uploads/2016/10/DSC_0136.jpg" alt="" width="380" height="268" />The Research Core team collaborates with local communities to develop and conduct research that benefits the research participants and the broader community as well. The research contributes to improved community and population health and includes new models for preventing chronic disease and other public health problems.

<a href="https://prevention.ucsf.edu/about/prc-projects/">Our research project</a> addresses a significant health disparity – HIV – among Black and Latino gay men who have sex with men (MSM). The intervention Project STYLE (“Strength Through Youth Livin’ Empowered”) seeks adapt and replicate STYLE, a model intervention to improve linkage of HIV-infected young MSM of color to clinical care. STYLE project has these core elements:
<ul>
 	<li>Social marketing campaign</li>
 	<li>Community outreach &amp; HIV testing</li>
 	<li>Red carpet HIV services</li>
 	<li>HIV+ support services</li>
</ul>
<h3>Special Interest Projects (SIPs)</h3>
Special interest projects (SIPs) are funded by CDC and other federal agencies. The funder outlines broad goals for each SIP, which is offered only to the PRCs, and the grantee is selected through competitive peer-review. Each project is funded for at least one year, but many are multiyear projects that receive several million dollars.The following SIPs are currently funded through the UCSF PRC:

		<content><![CDATA[<h3>Early History: 1981-1998</h3>
<h4>Beginnings<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/prc/center-descriptions/university-california-sanfrancisco.htm"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2714" src="/sites/prevention.ucsf.edu/files/uploads/2016/10/PRC_30.png" alt="CDC Prevention Research Center 30th" width="395" height="176" /></a></h4>
In 1981, public health leaders proposed a network for applied public health research after which the<a title="About Program" href="http://www.cdc.gov/prc/about-prc-program/index.htm" target="_blank"> Prevention Research Center (PRC) Program</a> took shape as the first three research centers were funded. In 1984, Congress authorized the Secretary of Health and Human Services to select academic health centers to conduct community-based public health research. The CDC was identified as the administrator of the PRC Program.
<h4>The 1990s</h4>
In 1990, the PRC program grew to seven research centers, and by 1993, had expanded to nine research centers. In 1994, four additional centers brought prevention research to tribal governments, Appalachia, and the Ozarks, and the total number of centers reached 13.

In 1995, the National Health Institute<strong> (</strong>NIH) selected the PRC Program for the community component of the <a href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/whi/background.htm" target="_self">Women’s Health Initiative</a> and added one center in 1996 to address the national health concern of teenage pregnancy<strong>.</strong> In 1998, Congress reauthorized the PRC Program and nine centers were added to expand regional scope and broaden research themes, bringing the total number of PRCs to 23. The PRCs established thematic networks which collaborated on topics including the following: tobacco prevention and control; behavioral risk factor surveillance system; school health; women’s cardiovascular health; and oral health. This networking concept continued for new themes as those above became inactive over time.
<h3>Recent History: 2000-present</h3>
In 2000, one center was added to address the disproportionate burden of cancer in central Appalachia, and in 2001, two additional centers enhanced the program’s research depth and breadth, which brought the total number of centers to 26.  In 2002, two additional centers were selected to expand the network’s research capacity in both urban and rural health issues. In 2003, the PRC Program adopted a framework or logic model (http://www.cdc.gov/prc/about-prc-program/logicmodel.htm) for conceptualizing the research process and describing the activities of the program and the outcomes it expects to achieve.
<h4>20 years of PRCs’ achievements</h4>
In 2004, the CDC acknowledged 20 years of PRCs’ achievements, and the CDC announced the 2004–2009 research period for 33 centers. The PRCs collaborated on new thematic networks: <a href="http://www.globalobesity.org/gopc-news/paprn.html" target="_self">Physical Activity Policy Research Network</a>; 2005 Cardiovascular Health Network; 2007 – <a href="http://web1.sph.emory.edu/ManagingEpilepsyWell/" target="_self">Managing Epilepsy Well Network</a>; and 2008 <a href="http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nopren/" target="_self">Nutrition and Obesity Policy Research Network</a>

In 2009, the PRC Program co-sponsored the 20th National Conference on Chronic Disease Prevention and Control, and the CDC funded 37 Prevention Research Centers for the 2010–2014 research period; 5 developmental and 32 comprehensive. In 2014, CDC funded 26 new PRCs for a five-year period. The UCSF PRC had become one of the 26 funded PRCs.

CDC also funds 56 Special Interest Project (SIP) awards to 21 PRCs to design, test, and disseminate effective applied public health prevention research strategies.]]>    </content>

		<title>Developmental Core</title>
		<tax>1736</tax>
		<content><![CDATA[The Developmental Core promotes innovative interdisciplinary work, with special focus on international and US ethnic minority research, and the capacity to respond quickly to changes in the epidemic. Here’s how:
<h3>Consults and Mentoring</h3>
We provide mentoring and consultation to CAPS researchers on topics such as career direction, program of research ideas, and personal–work life balance. Consultations are for faculty at all levels, faculty aspirants, and fellows.
<h3>Presentations</h3>
CAPS Town Halls, usually held at noon on Fridays, focus on emerging issues and stimulate research innovation. Scientists and staff are strongly encouraged to attend. We hold different types of Town Halls:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>CAPS Updates</strong> feature CAPS scientists talking about their research.</li>
 	<li><strong>Scientist Updates </strong>feature non-CAPS scientists discussing their current research, which may include relevant non-AIDS as well as AIDS research.</li>
 	<li>A <strong>Master’s Series</strong> features distinguished speakers presenting on the state of the art in their AIDS-related fields.</li>
 	<li><strong>Community Town Halls </strong>feature experts from local community-based agencies who present the programs and research being conducted at the community level.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Interest Groups</h3>
These groups are organized to stimulate innovation in various areas. Groups usually meet monthly. Current interest groups include those focused on Prevention with Positives, Couples, and Technical Assistance.
<h3>Innovative Grants Program</h3>
This program supports pilot studies with the theme of innovation in HIV/AIDS social-behavioral or policy research. The focus is on multidisciplinary work and populations at especially high risk for HIV. <a href="https://prevention.ucsf.edu/developmental-core/developmental-coreinnovative-grants/">More about the Innovative Grants Program here</a>.
<h3>Peer Review</h3>
Peer review provides important opportunities for brainstorming, discussing scientific issues, and reviewing and contributing to each other’s work—manuscripts, grant proposals, and presentations—assuring that they are of the highest quality before they go out the door. All work supported by CAPS grants, conducted by CAPS investigators, or for publication anywhere CAPS is cited should go through the peer review system.

Peer review also ensures that our work is relevant to and reflective of the needs of the community. The CAPS <a href="https://prevention.ucsf.edu/about/community-advisory-board/">Community Advisory Board</a> is notified of peer reviews, and members are normally invited to attend and offer feedback.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Grant proposals </strong>must undergo peer review before submission. The chair of the review must report the outcome of the review and any required modifications to the director.</li>
 	<li><strong>Early career scientists</strong> must go through an early-stage concept review; others are encouraged to do so as well.</li>
 	<li><strong>Summary sheets and scientists’ responses</strong> are reviewed prior to proposal resubmission. Peer review is also held for unsuccessful submissions to discuss review committees’ feedback and options for next steps.</li>
 	<li><strong>Manuscripts</strong> for journal submission are reviewed at least once to ensure scientific content and presentation (e.g., focus, clarity, logic, coherence) are of the highest quality. These reviews are strongly encouraged, particularly for early career faculty, but not required.</li>
 	<li><strong>Abstract submissions, oral presentations and slides, and posters</strong> are routinely peer reviewed for scientific merit and effectiveness in communicating findings.</li>
 	<li><strong><a href="/sites/prevention.ucsf.edu/files/uploads/CAPS/about/pdf/CAPS_Peer_Review_Guidelines.pdf">Peer Review Guidelines</a></strong> outline the roles of reviewers, reviewees, and the review chair. Contact <a href="https://prevention.ucsf.edu/people/stuart-gaffney/">Stuart Gaffney</a> with questions or to schedule a peer review.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fellowships</h3>
We support the <a href="https://prevention.ucsf.edu/education/traineeships-in-aids-prevention-studies/">Traineeships in AIDS Prevention</a> (TAPS) and <a href="https://prevention.ucsf.edu/education/visiting-professor-program/">Collaborative HIV Prevention Research in Minority Communities</a> training programs.

		<title>CAPS History</title>
		<tax>1736</tax>
		<content><![CDATA[From the start of the HIV epidemic, scientists in San Francisco have been at the forefront of HIV prevention science. As the HIV epidemic and national needs evolve, CAPS alters its research emphasis to stay on the cutting edge of HIV prevention science.
<h3>Early History: 1986–2000</h3>
<h4>Beginnings</h4>
In 1981, the first cases of AIDS were identified in San Francisco as well as in New York and Los Angeles. Even before HIV was discovered, it was recognized that AIDS was likely a blood-borne, sexually transmitted disease and that behavioral factors were probably associated with its spread. Behavioral scientists in San Francisco investigated behaviors among at-risk populations in San Francisco and the consequences of HIV in the community.

The Center for AIDS Prevention Studies (CAPS) was established in 1986 and focused on the prevalence of HIV disease and risk behaviors. A grant from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) allowed us to attract a group of scientists and to establish a center of excellence for training medical, social, and behavioral scientists.
<h4>The 1990s</h4>
By the early 1990s, the modes of HIV transmission and the epidemiology of risk behaviors were well understood, and some early evidence about the determinants of high-risk behavior were emerging. Hence, CAPS began to focus more explicitly on descriptive studies of the negative consequences of HIV disease and on developing prevention interventions and rigorously evaluating them. For example, CAPS scientists demonstrated the effectiveness of HIV testing and counseling as a prevention strategy.

We knew that our research was for naught if it did not get to those who needed it most: prevention service providers. And so we created the Technology and Information Exchange (TIE) Core to provide a feedback loop between CAPS and the community.
<h4>The HAART Era</h4>
In 1996, with the beginning of the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), we added a new dimension: integration across disciplines. We integrated social, psychological, and biomedical perspectives to understand the impact of HAART on risk behavior and seroincidence. We worked on cross-disciplinary studies of HIV and other diseases or behaviors (e.g., stress and coping studies) and began to develop a portfolio of studies on policy and ethics issues in HIV/AIDS research and care.

In keeping with the demographics of the epidemic, we greatly expanded our research portfolio on HIV prevention in ethnic minority communities. In addition, we increased our commitment to training scientists to conduct research in minority communities by focusing our <a href="https://prevention.ucsf.edu/education/traineeships-in-aids-prevention-studies/">Traineeships in AIDS Prevention Studies</a> (TAPS, begun in 1989) fellowship program on recruitment of ethnic minority scientists and by establishing the <a href="https://prevention.ucsf.edu/education/visiting-professor-program/">Training Program for Scientists Conducting Research to Reduce HIV/STI Health Disparities</a>.
<h3>Recent History: 2001–present</h3>
Recognizing the growing importance and availability of a wide variety of biostatistical, qualitative, and electronic data recording methods in HIV research, we created a <a href="https://prevention.ucsf.edu/about/caps-structure-and-cores/methods-core/">Methods Core</a> to meet CAPS investigators’ increasing demand for expertise in these areas.

Our major training activities—TAPS and the Collaborative HIV Prevention Research in Minority Communities Program, both formerly funded by CAPS, as well as the International Traineeships in AIDS Prevention Studies—successfully competed for separate training grants.

During this period, we focused more extensively on the dissemination of science and translation of research to practice. With the addition of the <a href="http://paetc.org/" target="_blank">Pacific AIDS Education and Training Center</a> as a CAPS partner, our portfolio of research studies on HIV policy expanded beyond prevention to treatment and health services issues.
<h4>New Leadership</h4>
In 2006, CAPS successfully applied for renewed NIMH funding and took on new leadership with <a class="fancybox" href="https://prevention.ucsf.edu/people/steve-morin-phd/">Dr. Steve Morin</a> as director. During this time CAPS developed a more extensive focus on HIV policy research and work with local, state, federal, and global agencies

We recruited <a href="https://prevention.ucsf.edu/people/mlightfoot/">Dr. Marguerita Lightfoot</a> to CAPS in 2008 to serve as co-director and to lead efforts on adolescent HIV prevention and reducing disparities.

We also saw a steady expansion of international studies into 45 countries. Our international efforts have been aided by co-locating and joining forces with the UCSF program in Global Health Sciences, one of the few university-based degree programs preparing students for careers in implementation of global health programs, where about two-thirds of studies are focused on HIV/AIDS.
<h3>Scientific Accomplishments: 2006–present</h3>
Over a recent three-year period, CAPS investigators produced 472 publications in medical, public health, economic, and social science journals on issues relating to domestic and international HIV/AIDS prevention. Below we provide a brief summary of some CAPS research accomplishments, highlighting the innovative research programs of our early-career faculty.
<h4>Preventing New HIV Infections</h4>
We are proud of having produced a number of important social and behavioral interventions to reduce the number of new infections:
<ul>
 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.mpowerment.org/" target="_blank">Mpowerment</a>.</strong> This community-level intervention was found to be safe and effective in reducing behavioral HIV risk with young gay and bisexual men in a randomized, controlled trial. It is now one of the evidence-based interventions promoted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. To date, more than 150 domestic organizations (and a number of international groups) have implemented Mpowerment.</li>
 	<li><strong><a href="https://prevention.ucsf.edu/resources/intervention-curricula/">NIMH Healthy Living</a>. </strong>This multisite randomized, controlled trial established the safety and efficacy of a cognitive-behavioral intervention designed to reduce transmission risk behavior among HIV-positive persons. A CAPS team led by Drs. Morin, Johnson, and Lightfoot published the final trial outcomes which established a significant reduction in transmission risk acts for the intervention group compared to a control group.</li>
 	<li><strong>Enhancing positive prevention.</strong> The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) worked with a team of CAPS scientists led by Dr. Myers to assess the extent to which HIV prevention opportunities were being missed in Ryan White–funded clinics. HRSA launched an initiative to implement and evaluate HIV prevention interventions with HIV-positive patients in 15 primary health care settings across the country.</li>
 	<li><strong><a href="/sites/prevention.ucsf.edu/files/uploads/research/portfolio/2007/Risk6.pdf">NIMH Acute HIV Infection Study</a>.</strong> A team of investigators at CAPS led by Dr. Steward, an early-career researcher working with Dr. Morin, coordinated a multisite study to understand better the role of acute infection in HIV transmission. Five sites conducted in-depth qualitative interviews and longitudinal quantitative assessments of HIV transmission risk behavior among individuals diagnosed with acute or very recent HIV infection.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Optimizing HIV-Related Health Outcomes</h4>
A team of investigators at CAPS led by Dr. Johnson has developed a program of research to improve health outcomes through linkage to care, treatment engagement, retention in care, and improved adherence to AIDS-related medications:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Improving adherence.</strong> A team led by Drs. Johnson and Charlebois analyzed data from the <a href="https://prevention.ucsf.edu/resources/intervention-curricula/">Healthy Living Project</a> to assess the effect of the intervention model promoting treatment engagement on antiretroviral therapy adherence.</li>
 	<li><strong>Reducing substance abuse.</strong> Other studies conducted using baseline data from Healthy Living indicate that regular use of stimulants (e.g., cocaine, crack, methamphetamine) is independently associated with HIV disease markers.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Reducing Disparities</h4>
In light of the epidemiology of HIV in the US, CAPS investigators are focused on reducing HIV-related health disparities:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Race, socioeconomic status, and AIDS.</strong> Dr. Michael Arnold, as a fellow working with Dr. Rutherford at CAPS, collaborated with researchers at the San Francisco Department of Public Health to examine the role of socioeconomic context and race in AIDS treatment and survival among 4211 people with AIDS living in the City between 1996 and 2001.</li>
 	<li><a href="/sites/prevention.ucsf.edu/files/uploads/research/portfolio/2009/Rutherford_G-CochraneColl2009.pdf"><strong>Responding to the needs of African Americans</strong></a><strong>.</strong> In collaboration with the Cochrane HIV/AIDS Group, Dr. Darbes and her team completed and published a meta-analysis examining the efficacy of HIV prevention interventions with heterosexual African Americans.</li>
 	<li><strong><a href="https://prevention.ucsf.edu/people/mlightfoot/">Marginalized adolescents</a>. </strong>Dr. Lightfoot and her team are pursuing a program of research to develop innovative HIV prevention interventions for marginalized, underserved adolescent populations at elevated risk for HIV infection.</li>
 	<li><strong><a href="/sites/prevention.ucsf.edu/files/uploads/research/portfolio/2009/Arnold_E-Bruthas2009.pdf">The Bruthas Project</a>.</strong> This community-collaborative intervention seeks to prevent HIV risk behavior among African American men who have sex with men and with women but who do not form an identity around their same-sex behavior.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Global Response</h4>
Because global equity is also a priority for research at CAPS, a number of investigators are responding to the international pandemic:
<ul>
 	<li><strong><a href="http://hiv.cochrane.org/" target="_blank">Cochrane Collaborative HIV/AIDS Review Group on HIV Infection and AIDS</a>.</strong> The HIV/AIDS group is one of 52 Cochrane Collaborative Review Groups and the only one located in the US.</li>
 	<li><a href="/sites/prevention.ucsf.edu/files/uploads/research/portfolio/2009/Morin_S-ProjectAccept2009.pdf"><strong>NIMH Project Accept</strong></a><strong>.</strong> A team of investigators led by Dr. Morin and Ms. Khumalo-Sakutukwa developed and implemented a community-level, multisite intervention as part of the HIV Prevention Trials Network.</li>
 	<li><strong>International men who have sex with men (MSM).</strong> Investigators at CAPS have continued to focus on MSM as a most-at-risk population for HIV infection in international settings. Dr. Lane and his team conducted one of the first studies to estimate <a href="/sites/prevention.ucsf.edu/files/uploads/research/portfolio/2009/Lane_T-TownshipMSMinSAfrica2009.pdf">HIV prevalence among MSM in South Africa townships</a>. Work in China conducted by Dr. Choi and her team observed an HIV prevalence rate of 1.5% and a syphilis rate of 13.5% among MSM.</li>

		<title>About AARC – History and Aims</title>
		<tax>1736</tax>
		<content><![CDATA[<img class="wp-image-3490 size-full aligncenter" src="/sites/prevention.ucsf.edu/files/uploads/old-site/uploads/2013/05/Community-Research-Gears-2.1jpg.jpg" alt="Alameda AIDS Research Coalition (AARC)" width="657" height="503" />

Through a partnership between the UCSF Center for AIDS Prevention Studies (CAPS) and the AIDS Project East Bay (APEB), a stable, well-respected community-based organization in Oakland, CA (a community heavily impacted by STI/HIV and the first city to declare a state of emergency due to the high incidence of HIV/AIDS among African Americans), the consortium of researchers and community partners will develop strong, long-term relationships that bridge the gap between research and communities by developing trainings and forums to build the capacity of research partners to engage in community-involved research, leveraging existing electronic infrastructure to build support mechanisms for community-involved research, and seeding the next generation of STI/HIV research.

The primary aims of the AARC are to:
<ul>
 	<li>Develop a research consortium of academic researchers, CBO researchers, and community researchers to identify significant research questions, and design, implement and disseminate appropriate and scientifically rigorous research projects that address STI/HIV health disparities in the African American community;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>Increase the capacity of the members of the research consortium to participate in community collaborative research projects through relationship building activities, specialized trainings, and forums;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>Develop an electronic infrastructure to support, grow and ensure sustainability of the consortium and activities by archiving consortium trainings and forums, facilitating communication among consortium members, and providing a forum for support and problem-solving among the subgroups of the consortium; and</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>Stimulate and develop innovative research by providing funding to conduct pilot research that will yield data for collaborative presentations at national conferences and provide preliminary data for use by academic and CBO researchers when submitting future R01 grant proposals to NIH.</li>
</ul>
The AARC has held consistent meetings since Fall of 2010, has over 50 members and considers health disparities among African Americans (in prevention and treatment) as a high priority. The AARC currently is development of a research agenda for Alameda county which seeks to address the question: “What are the primary drivers involved the AIDS epidemic in Alameda county and how do we address them?”]]>    </content>

The value of community engagement in research, however, cannot be empirically determined without good measures of the level of community participation in research activities. Based on our recent evaluation of community–academic partnered projects centered around behavioral health issues, this article uses semistructured interview and survey data to outline two complementary approaches to measuring the level of community participation in research—a “three-model” approach that differentiates between the levels of community participation and a Community Engagement in Research Index (CERI) that offers a multidimensional view of community engagement in the research process. The primary goal of this article is to present and compare these approaches, discuss their strengths and limitations, summarize the lessons learned, and offer directions for future research. Although additional research is needed to validate these measures, our study makes a significant contribution by illustrating the complexity of measuring community participation in research and the lack of reliability in simple scores offered by the three-model approach.

<strong>Abstract:  </strong>As part of the MyResearch suite of applications, UCSF has made available two different online survey software packages: Qualtrics and Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap). These applications are available to the UCSF Research Community and its collaborators at no extra cost. This talk will present an overview and comparison of these two applications by using examples of their real life implementation in research projects. Topics will include primary features, benefits, shortcomings, and IT-support options. The goal is to enable investigators and data analysis personnel to decide if one or both of these tools can be useful for their research studies.<strong> </strong>

<strong>Bios: </strong>

<u>Sam Dilworth</u> is a long-time CAPS statistician/data manager, having worked on a wide array of projects at CAPS and SFGH. Her adventures in HIV-prevention research run the gamut, from studies on a cohort of homeless women, to harm-reduction among meth-using MSM, to longitudinal research with gay couples. As a data manager, she has extensive experience with programming surveys, maintaining databases for, and producing analysis-ready datasets from multiple data collection/survey software packages, including Qualtrics, RedCAP, QDS, CASIC, and Survey Monkey. Her statistical qualifications afford her the benefit of knowing how best to capture the data in terms of how it is needed for data quality, precision, and analysis. She has consulted with and advised other researchers on survey software solutions; created protocols for survey testing, data collection, and data management; and is driven to find, master, and apply the best survey software available for the needs of the study.

<u>Ms. Chakravarty</u> is a biostatistician at CAPS experienced in survey programming, survey data management and statistical analyses of HIV related data from diverse populations. She has been the statistician and data manager on numerous longitudinal studies including multi-site HRSA-funded demonstration studies as well as NIMH-funded studies on gay couples. She has programmed and managed surveys for Computer Assisted Survey Instrument (CASI) administration using QDS, REDCap and Qualtrics. She has created databases to facilitate the day-to-day recruitment tracking and similar administrative aspects of longitudinal dyadic studies. She has also developed data collection and data management protocols, trained appropriate personnel and supervised data collection.

		<title>Innovative Grants</title>
		<tax>1736</tax>
		<content><![CDATA[<strong>The CAPS HIV/AIDS Innovative Pilot Awards Program</strong> supports pilot studies for innovative HIV/AIDS prevention and policy research, prioritizing the funding of projects that will lead to future NIH R01 grant proposals or other substantive extramural funding. CAPS and the Innovative Grants Program are supported by a grant from the United States National Institute of Mental Health (P30 MH062246).
<h3>Areas of Research Supported</h3>
The HIV/AIDS Innovative Pilot Awards Program welcomes applications in two areas by providing (1) New Investigator Awards and (2) New Research Directions Awards.

<strong>New Investigator Awards</strong> support the work of scientists who have not previously been awarded NIH R01 funding or otherwise received extramural grant funding equivalent to R01s in terms of size and scope. New Investigator Awards are given to foster the research careers of early-career scientists by providing seed money to collect preliminary data in support of independent extramural funding applications. Because mentorship is important to developing a scientific career, principal investigators (PIs) of New Investigator Awards are asked to identify a mentor and describe the mentor’s role in guiding the research.

<strong>New Research Direction Awards</strong> support the work of established investigators who wish to pursue research topics that represent, for them, a substantial departure from their prior work. New Research Direction Awards are intended to provide seed money to collect preliminary data that will support future extramural grant applications in the new area of study.

Funding decisions are based on merit, responsiveness to the call for proposals, feasibility of completing the project in a timely manner, and availability of funds. The maximum award amount per project is $20,000. Proposed research projects should be completed within one year of receipt of funding.

The CAPS <a title="CAB" href="https://prevention.ucsf.edu/about/community-advisory-board/">Community Advisory Board</a> recommends that the following guidelines be considered in the selection of projects:
<ul>
 	<li>The proposed study should be innovative rather than something already well studied.</li>
 	<li>The proposed study should involve the target population in the formation of the protocol.</li>
 	<li>The application should explain how the proposed study fits into the larger body of published knowledge in the area.</li>
 	<li>The “So what?” question should be addressed; that is, the application should highlight the practical implications of the proposed project. The proposal should answer these questions: “To what will this study lead?” “Why is the proposed project a crucial step?” and “What does the study (or line of research) add to the HIV research puzzle?”</li>
</ul>
<h3>Eligibility</h3>
The primary purpose of the CAPS Innovative Grants Program is to foster innovative HIV prevention science and the research careers of promising new HIV prevention investigators. A Principal Investigator (PI) on an Innovative Grant must meet these requirements:
<ol>
 	<li>Hold a doctoral degree (PhD, MD, etc.) or equivalent educational credential</li>
 	<li>Have a UCSF faculty appointment
<em>or</em>
Hold a UCSF academic staff position (e.g., postdoctoral scholar, research specialist, principal statistician) and be working toward independent funding for promotion to the faculty</li>
 	<li>Have a UCSF home accounting department</li>
</ol>
<h3>Budgets</h3>
Budgets may not exceed $40,000. Because this is an internal UCSF grant, there are no indirect costs. Award money should be spent within one year of receipt of funding. Because of the small award amount and limited project time, subcontracts are only permitted with special permission.

<strong>Supplies and Expenses:</strong> Laboratory supplies, office supplies, and other necessary and reasonable expenses are allowed and must be fully justified in the application.

<strong>Equipment:</strong> Equipment is defined as non-expendable, tangible personal property that has an acquisition cost of $1,500 or more, is freestanding, and has a normal life expectancy of two years or more. Only equipment requested and fully justified in the application and approved in the award budget may be purchased with these funds.

<strong>Effort:</strong> Most PIs, mentors, and co-investigators cannot “donate” time to a project. They must invest some effort on the project, even if only 1%. An exception can be made if a faculty member has a discretionary source of salary that permits the donation of effort. (Funds from grants and contracts are rarely discretionary.) A second exception can be made for individuals who are supported by NIH training awards (e.g., postdoctoral training grants and early-career K awards). Individuals on these grants cannot be paid for their effort, as stipulated by the rules of their training award.
<h3>CHR/IRB Approvals</h3>
All studies that involve human participants require approval by the UCSF Committee on Human Research (CHR). However, approval is not a prerequisite for submission. If a project is selected for funding, proof of CHR approval must be supplied before funds can be released. If CHR approval is not obtained within 90 days of award notice, the offer of funding may be withdrawn. Per requirements of the National Institute of Mental Health, which supports CAPS and the Innovative Grants Program, projects conducted in international locations must also obtain approval from an appropriate foreign Institutional Review Board and secure U.S. State Department clearance prior to commencing research activities in the foreign location. Details on the process for securing State Department clearance will be provided, as appropriate, to applicants selected for funding.
<h3>Peer Review Process</h3>
CAPS convenes a panel of HIV/AIDS prevention and policy scientists and members of the CAPS Community Advisory Board to review applications and make recommendations for funding. Each proposal is reviewed in detail by at least three members of the panel. Proposals are then discussed in a meeting of the full review panel. Recommendations of the panel are forwarded to the CAPS Senior Leadership Group, which makes final award decisions.
<h3>Research Resources</h3>
CAPS offers multiple core resources for the design, conduct, and analysis of pilot research, and PIs are encouraged to use them in preparing Innovative Grant proposals. CAPS <a title="CAPS Cores" href="https://prevention.ucsf.edu/about/caps-structure-and-cores/">core services</a> include (1) a scientific mentoring and research training program (<a title="Developmental Core" href="https://prevention.ucsf.edu/developmental-core/">Developmental Core</a>); (2) consultation on clinical research study design, biostatistical analyses, qualitative research methods, and data management (<a title="Methods Core" href="https://prevention.ucsf.edu/about/caps-structure-and-cores/methods-core/">Methods Core</a>); (3) consultation on issues related to international research; (4) consultation on issues of policy and ethics; and (5) consultation on community collaboration and dissemination (<a href="https://prevention.ucsf.edu/about/caps-structure-and-cores/community-engagement-ce-core/">Community Engagement Core</a>).

As part of the submission, applicants are asked to describe other resources and infrastructure that may be available to them to facilitate timely completion of the project. Demonstrating access to such resources is particularly important for international projects, which often face additional hurdles to establishing successful collaborations and obtaining multiple IRB and governmental approvals.
<h3>Progress Reporting</h3>
Awardees are required to submit a brief progress report 6 months after funding and a final report after 12 months. Awardees will be asked to deliver a presentation about their research findings at a CAPS Town Hall. Funds are awarded with the expectation that the pilot studies will lead to extramural funding, and progress reports should be written with this in mind.

		<title>Replicating Mpowerment</title>
		<tax>1736</tax>
		<content><![CDATA[<h3>Mpowerment Project – Translating Research into Practice</h3>
This project is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Translating Research into Practice (TRIP). We have developed a state-of-the art, collaborative technology exchange system to help CBOs put the Mpowerment Project into practice in their communities. The Mpowerment Project Technology Exchange System (MPTES) is based on proven scientific principles including Diffusion of Innovations and Social Learning theories. The MPTES includes 1) a replication package consisting of two training manuals and two videotapes; 2) a 3-day comprehensive training program and on-site, follow-up trainings; 3) a technical assistance program; and 4) a variety of Internet services including a website, chat rooms, and a listserv.
<h4>What we’ve learned</h4>
Over 300 community-based organizations and health departments (CBOs/HDs) have requested assistance in implementing Mpowerment. The intervention is complex — it is theoretically sophisticated, involves multiple interrelated components, requires empowering young MSM as decision-makers, and uses community-organizing methods. But current theories about MSM and sexual risk behavior indicate that complex interventions are required to match the complex sociocultural contexts of sexual behavior and psychosocial issues affecting young MSM.

We found that replication materials alone were insufficient to effectively translate research to practice. Yet replication materials must provide abundant examples of implementation and guidelines to follow, while not dictating exactly how to implement the program. Training must be intensive and experiential, and must involve CBOs/HDs sharing their experiences with each other. TA must be individually tailored to the CBOs/HDs’ unique characteristics, communities, and stage of implementation. Also, it must be provided on a regular basis, not solely when CBOs/HDs recognize the need for it. Organizational issues must be taken into account in replication materials, training, and TA.

Effectively translating the evidence-based, community-level Mpowerment Project into practice requires a “second-generation intervention” focused on CBOs/HDs that want to implement the Project. This new intervention is called The Mpowerment Project Technology Exchange System (MPTES) and involves extensive collaboration with CBOs/HDs. In addition to replication materials, training, and TA, it also involves a website, an Internet chat room about the intervention, and an electronic discussion group.
<h4>Mpowerment in your ccommunity</h4>
Over the past several years, many organizations have expressed interest in implementing the Mpowerment Project and have contacted us with requests for information, training, and assistance with their efforts. In response to these requests, we have developed the following materials and services to assist organizations with their program implementation and evaluation efforts:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Mpowerment Project Replication Package.</strong> This low-cost package includes a 300-page Mpowerment Project Training Manual, an M-group Facilitator Guide, an M-group Meeting Guide, a 22-minute Overview videotape, and a 47-minute M-group Training videotape. All components are packaged inside an attractive binder.</li>
 	<li><strong>Initial Training.</strong> A low-cost, multiday introductory training gives participants an in-depth understanding of the Mpowerment Project and the chance to interact with the original researchers and former project coordinators.</li>
 	<li><strong>On-site Training.</strong> Organizations that are implementing the Mpowerment Project and who have attended the initial training may receive on-site, follow-up training from our staff of trained specialists.</li>
 	<li><strong>Technical Assistance.</strong> Organizations implementing the Mpowerment Project may also be eligible to receive free TA from our staff of trained specialists.</li>
 	<li><strong>Internet Resources.</strong> A variety of online resources may also be available to your organization, including a website with additional materials (<a href="http://www.mpowerment.org">www.mpowerment.org</a>), an online discussion group, and regularly scheduled online chats.</li>
</ul>

		<title>Program details</title>
		<tax>1736</tax>
		<content><![CDATA[The program typically admits 2-4 Visiting Professors each year. Because of the small number of participants, the six-week summer program at CAPS is specifically tailored to the needs of those attending. Each Visiting Professor attends three consecutive summer programs at CAPS.<img class="size-medium wp-image-6339 aligncenter" src="/sites/prevention.ucsf.edu/files/uploads/2017/10/Group-by-Emma-500x306.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="306" />
<ul>

<h3>What you can expect during each summer</h3>

<li>Participants will attend approximately 2-4 seminars per week. The seminars cover many aspects of the research/grant writing process, which are addressed in the context of the projects being developed by program participants. For more details, please see the <a href="https://prevention.ucsf.edu/summer-program-seminars/">description of Summer Program Seminars</a>.</li>

 	<li>Each week participants complete a writing assignment. The writing assignment is a section of their NIH grant proposal (i.e., specific aims, significance, approach).</li>
 	<li>Each week participants are expected to read other participant’s writing assignments and provide written comments. Program faculty also read each participant’s written products.</li>
 	<li>First year participants will also develop a concept sheet and IRB protocol for their pilot study.</li>
 	<li>At the end of the summer, a peer review is conducted for each participant’s grant proposal in a process that mimics the NIH peer review process. A program faculty, fellow Visiting Professor, and outside reviewer with expertise specific to the grant proposal’s topic will read and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the grant proposal. The reviewers also provide written feedback. Other participants are also expected to read their peers grant proposals and provide verbal feedback.</li>
 	<li>Depending on their progress, program participants may spend the second summer revising their original proposals from Year 1, or developing a second proposal to submit for NIH funding.</li>
 	<li>Through the seminars, weekly assignments, and reading each other’s work, participants gain an in-depth knowledge of each other’s research programs.</li>
</ul>
Program faculty also read each Visiting Professor’s written products, as well as lead seminars, offer mentorship, and provide consultation throughout the summer program. The structure of the summer program enables VPs and program faculty to develop collaborative relationships and provide valuable and meaningful input that improves VPs’ likelihood of receiving a favorable review at NIH. <a href="https://prevention.ucsf.edu/mentors/">Information about the research interests of the program faculty members is available here</a>.
<h3>Pilot study funding</h3>
We expect to fund each researcher for up to $20,000 to conduct preliminary research before the second summer. This pilot study should address critical issues regarding the feasibility of a larger study, thereby providing the data needed to strengthen an NIH grant proposal.
<h3>Stipend and travel support</h3>
Participants are appointed as UCSF Faculty during each summer program, and receive a stipend totaling $15,000. The stipend is taxable income and is paid in two installments, one after the first half of the summer program and the second at the end of the summer program. The stipend serves to help cover living expenses, including lodging, food, and local transportation. In addition to the stipend, the program offers up to $1,000 for round-trip airfare and travel costs to and from San Francisco each summer.
<h3>Other professional support</h3>
The Visiting Professors program also supports the dissemination of the research conducted by participants related to their participation in the program. The program provides funding of up to $2,000 for attending a scientific conference to present the findings of the CAPS pilot study. The program also provides funding of up to $3,000 for publishing the results of the pilot study in an open access journal.

In the time during the academic year between summer programs, program faculty from UCSF have ongoing contact with the participants to support their progress toward completing the preliminary study, analyzing and interpreting data, and preparing NIH grant proposals and manuscripts.
<h3>Housing</h3>
Participants are responsible for locating and paying for their housing in San Francisco. Campus Life Services at UCSF offers <a href="http://campuslifeservices.ucsf.edu/housing/?goto=start" target="_blank" rel="noopener">housing resources</a>, including <a href="http://campuslifeservices.ucsf.edu/housing/services/short_term_lodging_needs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">short-term lodging</a>, and there are a number of online listing services for short-term housing in the Bay Area (e.g., www.sabbaticalhomes.com).
<h3>Families</h3>
Visiting Professors are likely to have important commitments to their families and may wish to bring family members along to San Francisco during the summer program. Participants may wish to visit UCSF’s <a href="http://campuslifeservices.ucsf.edu/familyservices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Family Services Webpage</a>, which contains a Child Care Referral Service and other resources. A few Visiting Professors have successfully used their services in the past and have been satisfied with the quality of the referrals.]]>    </content>

		<content><![CDATA[The summer program for Visiting Professors at CAPS typically offers the following seminars. The exact combination of seminars varies each year to reflect the needs of each year’s cohort.
<h4>Seminars for all Visiting Professors</h4>
<h5>Introduction and Plan</h5>
The summer program begins with an orientation session conducted by program faculty. The session is an opportunity for Visiting Professors to learn details about what to expect from the summer program and what assignments are required to be completed.
<h5>Science Chats</h5>
To start the summer program, Visiting Professors and faculty meet together to provide an opportunity for each Visiting Professor to share their research and to receive input for the work they are planning to do during the summer program. The Visiting Professors learn from each other and the faculty about innovative research methods and theories, and share expertise regarding research with racial and ethnic minority populations. These Science Chats are scheduled in the first week of the summer program.
<h5>Collaboration Lunches</h5>
Once a week, the Program provides a catered lunch and an extended time to network. Some of the lunches are provided for just the Visiting Professors, while others also include the CAPS program faculty.
<h5>Proposal Components</h5>
This seminar covers what to include – and not include – on the sections on an NIH proposal, with a special focus on the Specific Aims page.
<h5>NIH Biosketch</h5>
The seminar provides guidance in the preparation of an NIH biosketch, a document required with each grant proposal to NIH. Program faculty will present specific ways to communicate accomplishments in the field, and also how to select the most relevant awards and honors for inclusion.
<h5>Human Subjects Protection</h5>
Offered by program mentors with experience serving on the UCSF Committee on Human Research (CHR), this seminar covers issues of protecting research participants, including appropriate ways to contact participants, consent issues and language. The seminar also addresses the specific concerns that Visiting Professors may be facing in their work.
<h5>Budget Development</h5>
This seminar covers how to develop a well-justified budgeting plan and corresponding budget justification documentation for grant proposal submissions. The session covers issues such as “buying out” teaching time in order to carry out research, working with NIH/CDC project officers in the development of proposal budgets, how to conceptualize budgets and their relationship with the science, and methods for assuring that budgets incorporate all necessary items.
<h5>Intervention Planning</h5>
This seminar covers developing and implementing social and behavioral interventions, particularly as they pertain to ethnic and racial minorities. Issues examined include recruitment and retention of participants into interventions; whether to conduct individual, group or community-level approaches; the “dose” of the intervention; assignment of participants to study conditions; and avoiding intervention contamination of control group participants.
<h5>NIH Public Access Policy</h5>
Visiting Professors will gain an understanding of the rationale for the NIH Public Access Policy, what the policy covers and how to comply with the policy. The seminar also includes a discussion of how Open Access and other related developments are impacting the conduct of clinical research.
<h5>Topics in Substance Use and HIV Prevention</h5>
National expert seminar leaders present on the latest research on the intersection of substance use and HIV. The topics of seminars have included the physiological effects of substance use, adolescent development and substance use, the use of social networks for investigating injection and other drug use, and how the criminalization of substance use disproportionately impacts racial and ethnic minority communities.
<h5>Community Collaborations</h5>
Offered by the CAPS TIE Core, this seminar examines the theory and process of collaborative research involving academic researchers and community partners. The seminar reviews community collaborative research being conducted by CAPS investigators and addresses ways to initiate and nurture collaborative research relationships.
<h5>Overview of NIH Reviews</h5>
This seminar is hosted by CAPS faculty who have served on NIH review panels and covers various aspects of the NIH grant submission and review process, including “dos” and “don’ts” for grant applicants.
<h5>Early Peer Review</h5>
CAPS has a tradition of internal peer review that allows its researchers to gain valuable feedback about their proposals and manuscripts prior to submission. Since Visiting Professors have a range of experience with the peer review process, a peer review is conducted early in the summer program. The subject of the peer review is typically a proposal by a current or former Visiting Professor. Peer reviewers are drawn from the CAPS faculty. All Visiting Professors are asked to review the materials ahead of time and then attend the peer review so that they can directly observe how a peer review can function within norms and practices that encourage constructive criticism.
<h5>Peer Review</h5>
In the last two weeks of the program, Visiting Professors submit their summer’s work (typically, a draft of an NIH research proposal) for a peer review. During the peer review, each Visiting Professor’s summer product is formally reviewed in a one-hour group session by one of the program mentors, a researcher with relevant expertise from outside the Visiting Professor Program, and a Visiting Professor. Typically, all mentors and Visiting Professors attend all peer reviews. The formal component of each peer review session lasts about 30 minutes, with each peer reviewer offering seven minutes of commentary on the review product. Reviewers also supply written comments to the Visiting Professor whose work is being reviewed. The remaining 30 minutes is used for discussion and for others in attendance to provide additional comments. The discussions among Visiting Professors and mentors during the review are invaluable for refining the Visiting Professors’ proposals.
<h5>Evaluation Session</h5>
On the last day of the summer program, an Evaluation Session is held during which there is a structured discussion about how various program elements have been more or less helpful in realizing the program goals and objectives. The session frequently results in feedback that is used to adjust the program in future years. The session also compliments an anonymous, written evaluation survey that is sent after the summer program is complete.
<h4>First Year Seminars</h4>
<h5>UCSF Subcontract Process</h5>
The seminar provides an explanation of the requirements for the subcontract for a pilot study while introducing the UCSF staff who are instrumental in the implementation of a subcontract agreement.
<h5>Writing Human Subjects and Inclusion Sections</h5>
Offered by program mentors with experience serving on the UCSF Committee on Human Research (CHR), this seminar discusses approaches to cover the areas of the study relevant to the Human Subjects section of the grant, as well as the grant sections on Inclusion of Women and Minorities and Inclusion of Children. The seminar addresses the specific issues that arise for Visiting Professors writing up their proposed pilot projects.
<h4>Second and Third Year Seminars</h4>
<h5>Research Planning</h5>
These weekly two-hour seminars allow scientists analyzing formative data and preparing a grant proposal to receive input from mentors and other participants on how to interpret pilot data and integrate analysis results into a grant proposal. These sessions also provide assistance in other areas of grant writing. Different pairs of mentors co-lead these seminars each week so that Visiting Professors receive exposure to different disciplinary perspectives and expertise.
<h4>Other Seminars</h4>
<h5>Individual Consults</h5>
In addition to the formal activities described above, an important facet of the program is informal one-on-one or small group consultations between UCSF faculty mentors and Visiting Professors and between Visiting Professors.
<h4>Additional seminars</h4>
Additional seminars are offered to participating Visiting Professors as the need arises. Examples include funding opportunities at NIH and CDC and advanced qualitative and quantitative research methods. Visiting Professors also have the opportunity to attend trainings and seminars that are part of the wider CAPS and UCSF community, such as the CAPS Town Halls and Department of Medicine Grand Rounds.]]>    </content>

		<title>Quotes about the program</title>
		<tax>1736</tax>
		<content><![CDATA[<h3>From the 2012 summer program</h3>
“I won the NIH Loan Repayment Program as a result of my work of the work I have done with the mentors. I have also established research collaborations as a result of the networking that was established by the mentors.”

“This is the only time during the year that I get to devote my entire efforts to developing this project. During the year, I have to teach, serve on committees and do other things. In addition, CAPS provides access to the resources, faculty mentors, scholars, and structured time that I would not have during a typical summer.”

“Having access to the CAPS faculty during the program was invaluable because we have individual time with them to focus on our project alone, bringing their skills and expertise to bear in the meetings.”

“I enjoy the face time with my primary mentor and the option to meet with other faculty in person.”

“To have the opportunity to work closely with nationally recognized experts in this field – people who are invested in your success almost as much as you are – is perhaps the most valuable aspect of this program. I have participated in other training programs, but nothing like this.”

“The unique aspect of CAPS is the sustainability. You really get the sense that you are joining a family of researchers with the same goals: to reduce health disparities and HIV prevalence. It is a collection of scientist who working from various angles to help eradicate this epidemic. It is a great environment.”

“Day and day out, I was consumed by nothing else but my project; as a result, I made incredible progress. This progress could not have been achieved at home with distractions of work and family.”

“Faculty members have helped me deepen my own ideas about HIV prevention as well as helping me find new data sets to explore my ideas. Being able to build personal, in-person relationships with CAPS faculty has helped me build stronger collaborative networks that led to new writing projects and potential grants and opportunities to strengthen existing manuscripts.”

“The benefits of being able to connect with faculty mentors in person while at CAPS are countless. We were able to have access to mentors in realtime, and the access to get feedback through science chats. I was able to have individual meetings to share my ideas and get comments or a different perspective. I was able to do mock qualitative face-to-face interviews with mentors and get feedback in preparation for conducting the actual interviews once my pilot study begins. I had access to CAPS resources that are not accessible online.”

<h3>From the 2011 summer program</h3>
“The VP CAPS program is an outstanding opportunity to learn about writing NIH grants, deepen methodological skills, and build strong collaborative relationships with colleagues.”

“This is the most supportive and intellectually stimulating environment that I have ever had the pleasure of participating in.”

“It was great to see the trajectory of the research careers of each scholar. Their warmth and support was really wonderful.”

“This program connected me to an amazing network of senior scientists conducting research directly related to my own research interests and passions. I’ve been connected with other junior faculty and research scientists – relationships that support my own intellectual and scholarly growth.”

<h3>From the 2010 summer program</h3>
“The VP program expanded my knowledge and skill base exponentially. More importantly, I became part of a lifelong community of researchers and collaborators dedicated to high quality HIV prevention research. It was an invaluable experience, and I still have two more years to go!”

“The unique training environment provided by CAPS is unparalleled. CAPS faculty engage with your work in ways that improve one’s ability to conduct the type of research necessary to meaningfully address HIV/AIDS-related disparities in ethnic minority communities. I am a better scientist because of my time at CAPS.”

“The intellectually challenging yet supportive environment of CAPS provided me with an opportunity to discuss and conceptualize my ideas with a group of experts who expressed a genuine interest in the success my program of research and career.”

“The CAPS VP program lives up to the hype (and more). The time that I spent learning with and from the faculty and other visiting professors has helped to accelerate my program of research and strengthened my confidence in my abilities as a scientist in the field of HIV prevention research.”

<h3>From the 2008 summer program</h3>

“Fantastic program. Really helped my productivity and helped me create a grant proposal that I was really proud of.”

“One of the best experiences of my professional training… The faculty is extremely knowledgeable about scientific research, publishing and the whole grant writing and review process…something critical for any junior faculty like me… Moreover, the relationships formed between the VP and their Mentor last forever…I am getting way much more out of the program than I expected!”

“The VP program is a home away from home. The faculty have always been very encouraging and supportive of my ideas and research goals. They provided advice about the nuts and bolts of putting together a successful research plan, as well as offered their wisdom on how to navigate life as successful independent researcher. I’ve got the grants but more importantly I have colleagues and friends I can call upon for a lifetime. Anyone looking to be a successful HIV prevention researcher in communities of color would benefit greatly from the program.”

“The faculty are extremely talented and committed to supporting the VPs. There is a “real” commitment to seeing us do well.”

<h3>From the 2007 summer program</h3>
“As HIV is further recognized as a disease of the disenfranchised, the VP program is an important social justice response. Bringing together highly trained scientists to receive additional support to effect change is a most significant contribution in the fight against HIV disease.”

“Come prepared to work hard, risk being fully exhausted at the end of the summer fellowship, but learn and grow intellectually in ways you never imagined.”

“It’s difficult to put into words the professional contributions of this program. It has an impact that is broad-based and time-released, providing contacts and support structures that allow the fellow to realize professional goals with maximal success, while meeting the individual where he/she is currently located in terms of scholarly development.”

<h3>From the 2006 summer program</h3>

“The program has helped to strengthen my research development skills with every visit. The scholarly interaction between the faculty and the visiting professors is scientifically stimulating.”

“The CAPS VP program breathes new life into the research world by giving a voice to junior faculty who have fresh ideas and experiences from different perspectives. This is a very hands on and personalized program which takes a lot of hard work and tenacity. But I wouldn’t trade it for anything. CAPS faculty values VP ideas, while simultaneously giving critical feedback on theory development and grantsmanship. The program assists our success as scientists and ultimately our goal of curbing the HIV epidemic in communities of color.”

“The CAPS program is a model training program for individuals committed to research in ethnic minority communities. The program provides high quality scientific mentoring and effectively trains investigators to become competitive in seeking federal funding. “

“The VP program at CAPS provides an unparalleled opportunity to receive training to help fight HIV disease from a research perspective. The intellectual generosity and supportive endeavors of the faculty inspire dedicated researchers to learn more and strive for higher quality research acumen and skill. Through my training here, I am convinced that the future beneficiaries of my research will owe a debt of gratitude to the faculty and peer VPs of the VP program.”

“Every aspect of my experience in the Visiting Professors program was extraordinarily helpful. The faculty at CAPS has vision and a deep sense of commitment to work with the Visiting Professors. The breadth of scholarly expertise in HIV and AIDS prevention along with a caring work ethic were core elements of the program.”

<h3>From the 2005 summer program</h3>
“What a wonderful opportunity! This program gave me the chance to think intensely about my line of research for six (mostly) uninterrupted weeks; something that rarely happens during the academic year. It also gave me the chance to get good feedback about my work from colleagues doing similar work across different disciplines. The workshops on writing grants and qualitative methodologies were especially useful.”

“The program has had an undeniably positive impact on my professional development. It has been an extremely rewarding experience in multiple ways.”

“Come prepared to work hard and learn an incredible amount. This program is not for the “faint of heart,” but you will reap endless dividends.”

“This program was so amazing. I had the chance to meet other faculty across the country with similar interests and learn from them. The feedback regarding my project and more importantly how to best chart my research career was invaluable. This program is like no other! I feel very honored to have been selected as a VP.”

“You come with your research idea and you leave with a support network of faculty and colleagues as well as renewed passion and belief in the value of HIV prevention research.”

<h3>From the 2004 summer program</h3>

“This is an outstanding program. It is a diverse, supportive, and intellectually stimulating group of scholars and you will find your work all the better for it. And for that, we give a lot to each other and truly embrace the spirit of scholarly collaboration, gentle but rigorous critique, and encouragement of each other’s research endeavors.”

“This was a fantastic and potentially career-changing experience! The Minorities program at CAPS puts the Visiting Professors through what an anthropologist might call a “rite of passage,” and we are inevitably transformed (and for the better) through the process. This is also a demystifying process, since the support of the faculty in the program takes much of the mystery out of pursuing research support, and makes us feel we have the professional support to guide us through each step in the process.”

“My research and ideas were pushed in so may unexpected directions. I got little of what I had originally expected but exactly what I need to deepen my program of research.”

“The program is helpful in so many ways; an extremely well-crafted career development training ground, offering an ideal combination of support and encouragement, critical feedback, skills-building, and networking.”

<h3>From the 2003 summer program</h3>
“An excellent program that guides you along the research process in practical ways that traditional academic programs cannot.”

“The program provides an abundance of resources, all directed towards our development as researchers. I felt fully supported but also strongly challenged to hone my thinking. Thank you so much for a truly enriching experience that will have a major impact on my research career direction.”

“This is the type of program that can change your academic trajectory, particularly if you are reliant on soft money for survival.”

<h3>From the 2002 summer program</h3>
“Having been afforded the opportunity and privileged to get away from the “hustle and bustle” of academia to focus primarily of my program of research, with a group of “like thinkers” is something that I will value always. I strongly recommend this program to anyone who is engaged in or plans to engage in HIV prevention research with populations who are not mainstreamed.”

“The faculty and other VP’s have a genuine interest in helping us develop our work. This type of supportive community of HIV prevention researchers is a rare find for researchers of color.”

“This is an excellent program. It is a pleasure to share ideas with smart and concerned scholars who share a deep commitment to the wonderful communities to which we belong. The program is vital to our development as scholars and contributors of scholarly work.”

“This program promotes individual growth as a scientist within a professional non-minority and minority scientist network. The key to this program is to encourage and support the VPs to develop as scientists and to conduct scientific studies in HIV/AIDS research in different ethnic groups. The program also encourages the VPs to replicate the process of mentoring with others in their home universities.”

<h3>From the 2001 summer program</h3>
“It is a comprehensive program which is flexible and individualized to address each VP’s research topic. Professional mentoring to conduct scientific research in ethnic minority communities is the key of this program.”

“Unequivocally, my visiting professorship in the Collaborative HIV-Prevention Research in Minority Communities Program was the most intellectually stimulating and professionally fulfilling experience that I have had to date.”

<h3>From the 2000 summer program</h3>
“My experiences with this program have been extremely positive, due in large part to the collaborative spirit among the visiting professors and the sense of commitment to both the program and my work on behalf of the collaborators.”

“The opportunities provided by this program for networking, professional development and collaboration with experienced researchers who care about my work has been invaluable to me.”

<h3>From the 1999 summer program</h3>
“This program has been and should remain a model for development of junior faculty working with communities of color, not only in the area of HIV prevention, but in other areas of scientific research and community action. The intensity of the program, occurring over three summers; its long-term commitment to the visiting professors’ development; its impact on federal agencies; its contribution to science at the intersection of public health and culture; and most importantly, the supportive community it builds for faculty who often face unique challenges at their home institutions, are incomparable. The program deserves not only to be supported as generously as possible, but replicated in other fields of scientific research where investigators of color, and studies relevant to communities of color, are woefully under-represented.”

“The CAPS VP program has, without a doubt, been one of the most rewarding professional experiences that I have had to date. I feel honored to have spent three summers working with a group of people who share my commitment to groundbreaking HIV/AIDS research and interventions in communities of color. The CAPS faculty and other visiting professors are the most generous, supportive and intellectually innovative people that I’ve met during the course of my career. As for the program itself, I believe that being a part of it has had an invaluable impact on every aspect of my professional life. In short, I am a more critical and innovative thinker and a better teacher, researcher and writer as a consequence of this fabulous program.”

<h3>From the 1998 summer program</h3>
“The interactions with colleagues working on HIV/AIDS in minority populations and with CAPS faculty make this program a wonderful and supportive intellectual experience.”

“The interactions with colleagues working on HIV/AIDS in minority populations and with CAPS faculty make this program a wonderful and supportive intellectual experience.”

<h3>From the 1997 summer program</h3>
“The grant management seminar was valuable! Experienced grant managers shared concrete suggestions for project management, especially within the personnel domain. Presenters at the recruitment and retention seminar shared valuable resources and information on how to retain, and track hard-to-reach participants for longitudinal studies. I recently shared information I gained from this seminar with my university colleagues.”

“We found an environment where our research was not just tolerated but applauded. You listened to us and learned from us also. Collaboration among each other and among scholars and faculty have already begun.”

“The grant-making seminars were valuable. The guest speakers helped to identify the grant writing and funding process”

“We also would like to thank the National Institute of Mental Health for funding this project. We have all heard the expression, ‘We need more minority researchers in HIV prevention research.’ NIMH put their money where their mouth was and provided the funds to make this a reality. We believe these funds were well spent. Each of us is committed to a long and productive line of research aiming at understanding and preventing HIV in communities of color. Thank you! Asante! Gracias!”

“We are leaving six weeks later with much greater focus and specificity, a written plan for implementing the first phase of our research, commitment to carry out our programs of research, and most importantly, faith that it can be done.”

<h4>Marguerita Lightfoot, PhD</h4>
<strong>Professor | Director of CAPS</strong>

<img class="alignleft wp-image-3224 size-full" src="/sites/prevention.ucsf.edu/files/uploads/old-site/uploads/2011/04/Lightfoot.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="220" /> Dr. Lightfoot is Professor of Medicine at the UCSF School of Medicine, Chief for the Division of Prevention Science, and Director of the Center for Prevention Studies (CAPS) and UCSF Prevention Research Center (PRC). She has an established research career conducting community-involved research, receiving awards for my community partnership efforts. She has considerable experience designing and implementing preventive interventions and has developed culturally competent, efficacious HIV interventions for delinquent adolescents, runaway/homeless youth, youth living with HIV, and young MSM, including developing interventions for delivery via technology (e.g., computers, websites, mobile phone, video games). In particular, she developed an efficacious computer-based intervention to reduce the sexual risk behaviors of delinquent youth (published in the American Journal of Public Health), successfully adapted an intervention for youth living with HIV to youth in Uganda (published in Prevention Science), and developed a computer-based intervention implemented in medical settings to reduce the HIV transmission risk behavior of adults living with HIV (published in JAIDS). She is particularly interested in developing cost-effective interventions that are easily translatable with utility in community settings and utilizes new technologies to engage disenfranchised individuals in health promotion activities. She has also conducted psychotherapy with predominately African American and Latino adolescents, adults, and families infected and/or affected by HIV.

Dr. Boyer has been the recipient of many grant awards and has been a productive investigator, publishing widely in the area of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention in adolescents and young adults. Her program of research focuses on the development and evaluation of cognitive-behavioral and community-level intervention strategies utilizing both culturally competent and positive youth development frameworks to promote sexual health and to reduce the risk of STIs, HIV, and unintended pregnancy and their sequelae in adolescents and young adults (youth). Such interventions have been implemented in various groups, including high school students, teen and STD clinic patients, among at-risk youth residing in high STI prevalent urban neighborhoods, and military personnel, both domestically and internationally. Moreover, for the past 10 years Dr. Boyer was a member of the NIH-funded Adolescent Trials Network (ATN) where she served as a lead investigator and collaborated on a number of community-based participatory research community mobilization studies to examine social determinants and structural barriers to improve HIV prevention for at risk youth and linkage, engagement and retention in long-term HIV healthcare for HIV-infected youth. She is currently working with the San Francisco Department of Public Health, Community Health Equity and Promotion Branch to conduct community-engaged research to better understand social determinants associated with increased rates of STIs in San Francisco youth with the end goal of designing age-appropriate and culturally-tailored prevention strategies to reduce their risk and acquisition of STIs.

<h4>James L. Sorensen, PhD</h4>
<strong>Professor In Residence, Department of Psychiatry</strong>

Dr. Sorensen began work in substance abuse treatment research more than twenty five years ago, directing a National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)-funded double-blind investigation of detoxification from heroin. He developed and evaluated a community network approach to drug abuse treatment, assessed family therapy’s efficacy with methadone maintenance patients, tested the efficacy of small-group HIV education with drug users, evaluated the impact of case management for substance abusers with HIV/AIDS, investigated the utility of treating methadone maintenance patients in a therapeutic community, and conducted several studies of how to help people who inject drugs to better adhere to their HIV medications. Dr. Sorensen also leads the Western States Node of the NIDA Clinical Trials Network and a NIDA T32 training program in substance use treatment research. His research has focused on how to improve the treatment that we provide to people with substance use disorders.

<h4>Bill Woods, PhD</h4>
<strong>Professor, Department of Medicine</strong>

<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2931" src="/sites/prevention.ucsf.edu/files/uploads/old-site/uploads/2011/01/Woods-e1497553400592.jpg" alt="Bill Woods" width="150" height="220" />

Dr. Woods has been at CAPS since 1987, and has played a significant role in the writing and submission of fourteen federally funded grants. His principal research interests are in three areas of HIV prevention: substance use and treatment, HIV counseling and testing, and sexual risk environments such as bathhouses. His recent work tends to combine these areas, looking primarily at the risk environment with a focus on the presence of drug use and the impact of HIV testing in these environments.

As a licensed psychologist with a part-time private practice serving gay men between 1988 and 1998, Dr. Woods frequently used that clinical experience to inform and shape the research projects with which he was involved. For example, his clinical work among gay men suggested the value of measuring the impact of protease inhibitor medications on sexual risk behaviors, resulting in a 1997 publication in New England Journal of Medicine, “Are advances in treatment changing views about high-risk sex?” Dr. Woods’ additional areas of research activity are health risk and prevention behavior of gay and bisexual men, environmental influences on behavior, and environmental and cognitive interventions in health promotion.
