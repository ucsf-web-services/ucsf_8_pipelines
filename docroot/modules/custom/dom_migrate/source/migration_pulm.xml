			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;
			Welcome to the UCSF Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine Program. We are proud to be part of a terrific team of physicians, scientists, nurses and staff who are dedicated to delivering outstanding care to patients with critical illness, lung, allergic and sleep disorders and to innovation in patient care, teaching and research.&lt;/p&gt;


			&lt;p&gt;Our program encompasses 5 sites: UCSF Medical Center, UCSF Medical Center at Mount Zion, San Francisco General Hospital, the San Francisco Veteran’s Administration Hospital, and the UCSF Mission Bay campus. Our programs at all of these sites work closely together on our shared missions of outstanding patient care, research and teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/sites/pulmonary.ucsf.edu/files/images/pulm_chiefs.jpg&quot; &gt;&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot; style=&quot;text&#45;align:center;&quot;&gt;V. Courtney Broaddus, George Caughey and Dean Sheppard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The three of us have been working closely together for more than 20 years and have continued a more than 50&#45;year tradition of shared leadership in our program. A central component of our division is the Pulmonary and Critical Care fellowship program, which has trained many of the world’s leaders in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine and Biology. Our training program includes physicians and basic scientists and incorporates clinical training at each of our 4 hospitals and scientific research in all major centers, graduate programs and departments at UCSF. The program is funded by a large NIH T32 grant, now in its 37th year, We are continually working to improve all aspects of our program to maintain its standing as the world’s leader in Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Moffitt&#45;Long&#45;Mt Zion Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep:&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/pulmonary.ucsf.edu/files/images/zion_bw.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; class=&quot;imgRight&quot;/&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The modern version of the UCSF Pulmonary Division was founded together with the Cardiovascular Research Institute in 1956. The division has a long history of training the world’s leaders in pulmonary science and medicine. In the late 1970s, Critical Care was added to the training and clinical responsibilities of the division, to keep pace with the rapid expansion of Critical Care Units. In the early 1990s, to accommodate the growth of sleep medicine, the division built the UCSF Sleep Center at Mt. Zion. UCSF had a small Allergy Division that was not financially or academically sustainable on its own. Because of the close overlap between Pulmonary and Allergy in research and in management of patients with asthma, the Allergy division was merged into the new Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;VA Pulmonary Division:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Starting in the 1970s, the Pulmonary Subspecialists at the San Francisco VA Medical Center belonged to the Pulmonary Section of the Medical Service. Subsequently, as it became routine for Pulmonary Subspecialists to become double&#45;boarded in Intensive Care Medicine, the Section adopted the rubric Pulmonary and Critical Care, acknowledging the greater scope of practice of physicians within the section. This trend towards specialization in Critical Care culminated in July 2004 in the closing of the Medical ICU, which became staffed full time by internists derived from the Pulmonary/CCM Section as well as from the Anesthesiology Service. This increase in clinical responsibility lead to an increase in the number of VA&#45;based, VA&#45;supported physicians, most of whom also maintained NIH&#45;supported research programs, as well as the addition of full&#45;time nurse practitioners.
			&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/pulmonary.ucsf.edu/files/images/va_bw.jpeg&quot;  width=&quot;400&quot; class=&quot;imgLeft&quot;/&gt;
			The first decade of the 21st century also saw a remarkable increase in demand for Sleep Diagnostic and Clinical Services, culminating in the design and opening of a new 3&#45;bed full polysomnography unit in late 2011. In recognition of the large and increasing proportion of effort devoted to sleep disorders, the Section was renamed the Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine Section.
			 In the past several years, the Section also has shouldered responsibility for monitoring, followup and diagnosis of pulmonary nodules and other abnormalities, plus coordination of interventional biopsy, PET scanning, pathology, and surgical/oncological shared decision&#45;making. This has become a major clinical focus of the section because of the large number of chest abnormalities found incidentally and by deliberate screening of a patient population highly enriched in elderly, male, asbestos&#45;exposed, cigarette smokers at high risk of development bronchogenic carcinomas and other thoracic primary and metastastic malignancies. The rising numbers of identified abnormalities, as well as the newer emphasis on chemotherapy and other types of therapy targeted to specific tumor types and mutations, increased demand for biopsy material and staging prior to initiating therapy. To help meet this demand, bronchoscopy services expanded in 2010 to include endobronchial ultrasound to guide transbronchial needle aspiration biopsies by a core of physicians specifically trained in the technique. Because of the Section’s central role in cancer detection and coordination of decision&#45;making, which is unique in the UCSF system, The VA has become a critical site for training of pulmonary subspecialty fellows in this aspect of pulmonary medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;SFGH Pulmonary Division:&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/pulmonary.ucsf.edu/files/images/sfgh_bw.jpg&quot; class=&quot;imgRight&quot; alt=&quot;San Francisco General Hospital &#45; Black and White photo&quot;/&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The SFGH Pulmonary Division has functioned under 3 Division Chiefs, Dr. John Murray (1966&#45;1988), Dr. Phil Hopewell (1989&#45;1998) and Dr. Courtney Broaddus (1998 to current).

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;
			The Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine Program has a long history of providing outstanding clinical care, performing innovative research and training academic scientists and physicians. We currently have active, well&#45;funded clinical, translational and basic research programs in lung development, international lung health, pulmonary immunology, genetics of pulmonary and allergic diseases, lung transplantation, microbial pathogenesis, airway diseases, acute lung injury, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary malignancies and pulmonary health disparities. Our large, NIH training grant has been continuously funded since 1966. Our program has trained more than 120 Professors of Medicine, including 27 current and former division chiefs, 20 Department Chairs, 3 Deans and 1 University President. Nearly a quarter of all academic pulmonologists in the United States have trained at UCSF.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine Program includes the UCSF Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine division (based at the Parnassus and Mt. Zion sites), the Pulmonary and Critical Care divisions of the San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center and the San Francisco VA Medical Center, and the Lung Biology Center at UCSF’s Mission Bay campus. Each emphasizes different aspects of care for patients with lung disease and lung disease research.

			&lt;h3&gt;What is asthma?&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Asthma is a common disease of the lungs characterized by intermittent episodes of shortness of breath, wheezing, cough, and feelings of chest tightness. As the prevalence of allergies has increased in the past 50 years, the prevalence of asthma has also increased, and asthma now affects approximately 7% of the population. There is significant geographic variation in the prevalence of asthma with the highest prevalence occurring in countries with a western lifestyle. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;What causes asthma?&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Asthma occurs in genetically susceptible people who encounter environmental stimuli (especially in young childhood) that promote asthma. Although asthma is frequently one manifestation of an allergic tendency in an individual, it is not known why only ~25% of people with nasal allergies develop asthma. It is also not known why asthma is severe in some patients but relatively mild in most. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The environmental stimuli important for the development of asthma include allergens, viruses, bacteria, cigarette smoke, and food, but much needs to be learned about the relative importance of these different stimuli and the time windows that are important for specific environmental exposures. Also, it is thought that obesity is an independent risk factor for the development of asthma.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Why do the airways (“bronchial tubes”) narrow in asthma?&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;There are three main reasons for narrowing of the airways in asthma:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;ol&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Inflammation, or swelling, of the lining of the airway&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Bronchoconstriction, which happens when the muscles that wraps around the airway tighten and squeezes the airway&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Mucus overproduction, which happens when the airway makes too much mucus and blocks part or all of the airway&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ol&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Narrow airways cause the symptoms of asthma, which are wheezing, coughing, tightness of the chest, and shortness of breath. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;How is asthma diagnosed?&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Asthma is diagnosed based on a person’s history of symptoms and with tests that can be done in the clinic. These tests can include:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lung function tests&lt;/b&gt;:  these tests are designed to reveal narrowing of the airways and reversibility of such narrowing with inhaled drugs that open up the airways. Common lug function tests in asthma are spirometry and measures of peak flow (can be done with a hand held device)&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Measures of allergy&lt;/b&gt;:  Asthma is common in people with allergies to environmental allergens and allergen avoidance can help control asthma.  Allergen tests include skin prick tests or blood tests (for allergy proteins or for specific kinds of white blood cells, especially eosinophils).&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;


			&lt;h3&gt;How is asthma treated?&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Asthma is a disease for which treatment is effective in providing good symptom relief and freedom from attacks in most patients. Treatment includes asthma medications, allergen avoidance, and disease education. People with asthma usually work with a health care provider to make an asthma treatment plan. This can include:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Trigger avoidance&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Peak flow monitoring&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;An asthma action plan &#45; what to do when symptoms or peak flow get worse&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Asthma Attacks&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Asthma attacks are periods of uncontrolled asthma in which the patient experiences increased symptoms of shortness of breath, chest tightness, cough, and sputum. Asthma attacks can come on quickly following a specific exposure (e.g. cat dander exposure) or during exercise. Attacks can also come on more slowly (e.g. asthmatics who get a head cold often notice that their asthma gets worse over a day or two). &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Asthma attacks can sometimes be controlled by taking more frequent inhalations of albuterol until the attack resolves. More severe attacks, however, require a visit to an urgent care clinic or to the emergency room. Asthma attacks need to be taken seriously because they can sometimes be severe and even life threatening. Clues to a severe attacks include severe symptoms, or symptoms that are not relieved by albuterol. In addition, a history or prior attacks requiring treatment in a emergency room or in an intensive care unit should alert a patient that their asthma attack may need to be treated at the hospital.  Although death from acute asthma attacks is relatively uncommon, it does occur, and an important warning sign is a previous bad attack of asthma.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;What can someone who was recently diagnosed with asthma expect for their future health?&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;There is currently no cure for asthma. Medications and treatment plans can help reduce symptoms. While asthma can be very severe for some people, most people can lead normal lives with proper treatment. &lt;/p&gt;

Bronchoscopic Procedures ./pulmonary/care/bronchoscopic.html
		</Fname>
		<Tax>1736</Tax>
		<Path>./pulmonary/care/bronchoscopic.html</Path>
		<FileBody>

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Bronchoscopy is a procedure that is used to view the trachea and bronchial tubes and is used to diagnose lung disease and infection. It may also be used during the treatment of some lung conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;How the Test is Performed&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The procedure is performed using a flexible bronchoscope.  A bronchoscope is thin device, usually less than 1/2 inch wide and 2 feet long, which has a small camera on the end to allow the operator to see deep into the lungs.  The bronchoscope also has a channel that can be used to pass small instruments or fluid into the airway to collect samples. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;When the scope is in the area of interest the doctor will take some samples using any of the following techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Bronchoalveolar Lavage:  During this procedure the physician passes saline solution through the scope and into the airway and out to the lung.  The fluid is then suctioned back through the scope into a container where it can be sent to the lab for diagnostic testing. &lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Transbronchial Biopsies:  During this procedure a small forcep is passed through the scope into the lung and small samples of lung tissue are removed.  This tissue can then be sent to the lab for diagnostic testing.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Transbronchial Needle Aspiration:  During this procedure a small needle is passed through the bronchoscope and through the bronchial wall to sample lymph node or lung tissue.  &lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Brush Biopsy:  During this procedure a small brush is passed through the scope and into the airway where the brush can collect cells from an area of the airway wall.  The brush sample can then be sent to the lab for diagnostic testing.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;


			&lt;p&gt;There are other devices that may be used during bronchoscopy.  These include:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Endobronchial Ultrasound:  Using this tool, the physician can identify lymph nodes or abnormal areas of the lung using a small ultrasound probe that is attached to the end of a special bronchoscope&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Electromagnetic Navigational Bronchoscopy:  Using this tool, the physician will use special equipment that allows 3D reconstruction of the bronchial tubes and development of a pathway that helps guide the physician to an area of interest in the lungs to allow for sampling.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;How to Prepare for the Test&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Do not eat or drink anything at least 6 hours prior to the procedure.  You should not take blood thinning medication such as Coumadin or Heparin shots prior to the procedure. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;
			You will need to arrange to have someone pick you up from the bronchoscopy recovery area and drive you home.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;What to Expect Following the Test&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Following the procedure, you will not have a normal gag reflex for 1&#45;2 hours after the test.  Therefore you will not be able to eat or drink during this time.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;When the anesthetic wears off, your throat may be scratchy for a few days. &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;You will likely have an increased cough for a few days following the procedure. &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;You may have a low grade fever during the 24 hours following the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Why the Test is Performed&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;You may have a bronchoscopy to help your doctor diagnose lung problems. Your doctor will be able to inspect the bronchial tubes or take a sample of your lung tissue.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Common reasons to perform a bronchoscopy for diagnosis are:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;•	Lung growth, lymph node, atelectasis, or other changes seen on an x&#45;ray or other imaging test&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Suspected interstitial lung disease&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Coughing up blood (hemoptysis)&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Possible foreign object in the airway&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Cough that has lasted more than 3 months without any other explanation&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Infections in the lungs and bronchi that cannot be diagnosed any other way or need a certain type of diagnosis&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Inhaled toxic gas or chemical&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;To diagnose a lung rejection after a lung transplant&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Risks&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The physician will go through in the detail the risks associated with bronchoscopy.  In general, this procedure is very safe and associated with complications very rarely.  &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The main risks from bronchoscopy are:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Bleeding from biopsy sites&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Infection&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Pneumothorax is when a small hole is created in the lining of the lung&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;UCSF provides state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art care to patients with lung cancer and cancer that has metastasized to the chest. Our pulmonologists evaluate patients who have lung nodules, lung masses or symptoms suggestive of lung cancer. We can help to determine whether a patient has lung cancer, to help to manage the symptoms associated with lung cancer, and to provide ongoing care after treatment for lung cancer. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Lung Cancer Screening&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Screening with annual low dose CT scan of the chest in high risk individuals in one large randomized controlled trial (National Lung Screening Trial) was associated with a 20% decrease in lung cancer mortality and a 6.7% decrease in all&#45;cause mortality. UCSF Medical Center offers a Lung Cancer Screening Program for qualified candidates. Please see the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.radiology.ucsf.edu/patient&#45;care/services/lung&#45;cancer&#45;screening&#45;program&quot;&gt;Lung Cancer Screening Program website&lt;/a&gt; or call 415&#45;514&#45;8787 for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Advanced Bronchoscopic Procedures&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;UCSF Pulmonologists perform some of the most advanced bronchoscopic procedures that can be used to diagnose lung cancer, to determine the clinical stage, or to assist with treatment. These procedures include: &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Endobronchial Ultrasound (EBUS).&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Electromagnetic Navigation Guided Bronchoscopy.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Stent Placement.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Fiducial Marker placement to guide Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT).&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;UCSF pulmonologists work very closely with a team of Thoracic Surgeons, Thoracic Oncologists, and Thoracic Radiation Oncologists to offer the most advanced treatment possible.&lt;/p&gt;

COPD / Emphysema ./pulmonary/care/copd.html
		</Fname>
		<Tax>1736</Tax>
		<Path>./pulmonary/care/copd.html</Path>
		<FileBody>

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;What is COPD?&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, is the name given to a group of disorders characterized by narrowing of the breathing tubes that limits (obstructs) the movement of air in and out of the lungs.  Specific diseases in this group include chronic bronchitis and emphysema.  In the older literature and in certain parts of the world, COPD has been called chronic obstructive lung disease (COLD) or chronic obstructive airway disease (COAD), but the term COPD is now preferred.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;How is COPD Diagnosed?&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Chronic Bronchitis is a clinical diagnosis, based on a history of cough and sputum production.  Emphysema involves destruction of lung tissue, and can be confirmed by CT scans of the chest.  In most cases, COPD is associated with cigarette smoking.  The definitive test for COPD is a breathing test, sometimes called a Pulmonary Function Test, a Lung Function Test, or Spirometry.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;What are common Symptoms?&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Although the diagnosis of COPD is not difficult to make, many patients (perhaps the majority) remain undiagnosed.  This reflects, in part, the insidious onset of symptoms.  The most common symptoms are:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Shortness of breath&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Sputum (phlegm or mucus) production.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Chronic cough and sputum production may occur years before lung function becomes abnormal and are often attributed to smoking – the “smokers cough.”  It is important to understand that this is not normal, and any cough that persists more than a few weeks beyond a respiratory illness should probably be investigated.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;COPD is often confused with asthma, because some of the symptoms and physical signs are similar.  The major difference is that in asthma, most (or in many cases all) of the obstruction to airflow in the bronchial tubes is reversible.  In other words, when asthmatic patients are examined or tested in between attacks of their asthma, their lung function is often normal.  In contrast, once COPD is established, the lung function is never normal.  When patients have flares or “exacerbations” of COPD, they typically get better with administration of medication, but their lung function never normalizes, although it may return to their pre&#45;exacerbation baseline.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;How is COPD treated?&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Smoking cessation is key, and slows the progressive loss of lung fuction that is typical of COPD.  Medications can improve symptoms and quality of life, improve exercise tolerance, and reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations.  Exercise programs can be very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Are there new approaches to management of COPD or ongoing research?&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;UCSF has been designated as a COPD Clinical Research Center by the National Institutes of Health.  We are also a site in the NIH's SPIROMICS network.

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;About Cystic Fibrosis&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disease resulting from the amount or function of a cell protein called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR). Problems with CFTR alter how the body adjusts salt and water in certain tissues and body fluids.  A signature of CF is a high salt concentration in the sweat. Mucus another fluid normally produced in several organ systems becomes thick and sticky. This leads to tissue damage as mucus builds up and interferes with the normal function of those organs.  The lungs are primarily affected in most individuals with CF:  thick mucus blocks the airways and allows for infection by various types of microbes.  Thick mucus also impacts other organ systems including the gastrointestinal tract (pancreas, liver, gallbladder, and intestines), reproductive tract and the upper respiratory tract (sinuses).  These result in other complications of CF such as difficulty digesting and absorbing nutrients from food, impaired intestinal motility, increased risk for diabetes, and problems with infertility.
			While CF is a chronic and usually progressive disease, advances in CF therapies and disease management in recent decades, have improved survival dramatically.  Median survival of patients with CF is now in the late 30s, and many patients are living with CF in their 50s and beyond. Sustaining health by following daily self&#45;care regimens and regular visits with an integrated Adult Cystic Fibrosis Care Team has enabled many individuals to grow into adulthood and live full lives.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;UCSF Adult Cystic Fibrosis Program&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Adults with cystic fibrosis have received care at UCSF for over thirty years. Many cystic fibrosis specialists throughout the State of California were trained by the Pulmonary Division of UCSF Department of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The UCSF Adult Cystic Fibrosis Program is accredited by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the State of California Department of Health.  The Adult CF Program is led by adult lung specialists in the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine (Mary Ellen Kleinhenz, MD, and Yvonne Huang, MD).  Individuals who are 18 years of age and older are seen, including many older individuals with CF. A team of experienced providers from nursing, nutrition, social work and respiratory therapy provide the expert care required by adults with CF in the ambulatory and inpatient settings. The Adult CF Care team also works closely with the pediatric CF care team at UCSF to help prepare patients for the transition from pediatric to adult CF Care. This integrated CF care team approach addresses and manages the needs and issues faced by CF patients and their families. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Physicians:&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Adult CF Program Director: &lt;a href=&quot;/about/faculty.html?key=218516c0a4f31e6ebef58108c368f55b&amp;name=KLEINHENZ%2CMARY+ELLEN&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mary Ellen Kleinhenz, MD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

				&lt;li&gt;CF Social Worker:  Monica Eisenhardt, LCSW&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;In addition, CF patients who require hospitalization are cared for by adult pulmonologists on the Advanced Lung Disease Service who are experienced in caring for patients with CF.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Clinic Services:&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The Adult Cystic Fibrosis Care team sees patients weekly on Wednesday mornings in the Chest Practice (5th Floor) of the UCSF Ambulatory Care Center, 400 Parnassus Avenue. Appointments can be scheduled at &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;(415) 353&#45;2961&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Initial appointments are made by referral from a patient’s primary care physician, pulmonologist or another CF Center. Current medical records will be requested and reviewed. Patients will be contacted with an appointment date and time.  Patients will continue to see their primary care physician for health needs that are unrelated to cystic fibrosis.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;For patients who are transitioning from the UCSF Pediatric CF Center, the Adult CF team makes every effort to meet the patient and family prior to a first appointment in the Adult Clinic at Parnassus. This may take place in the hospital or pediatric clinic setting depending on circumstances.  &lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;To meet special needs of young adults who are transferring to Adult CF Care while in college or living with family in the East Bay, we have initiated an “outreach” clinic in Pleasanton, CA staffed by our adult nurse practitioner, Diana Dawson, PNP. The “outreach” clinic is available to patients with stable health and an effective CF regimen. Patients attending this outreach clinic agree to be seen by Adult CF Team during CF Clinic on the Parnassus campus at least once each year. &lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Follow&#45;up visits 4 times a year are encouraged for all patients, as recommended by Cystic Fibrosis Foundation CF Care guidelines.  For patients with limited travel resources, there may be assistance available from Medi&#45;Cal or other programs. Patients are urged to contact the Adult CF Social Worker, Monica Eisenhardt, LCSW, for information. The Adult CF Care Team is highly vested in the care and well&#45;being of our patients. In return, we expect patients will make every effort to participate responsibly in their medical care. &lt;/li&gt;

			The Adult Pulmonary Function Lab offers a diverse range of physiology studies. Below is a comprehensive list. Please click on the following link to learn more details about each study: &lt;a href= &quot;https://apflab.ucsf.edu/lab/index.html&quot;&gt;Lab Study List&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;ol&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pulmonary Function Test (PFT):&lt;/b&gt; This test measures lung function.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Spirometry:&lt;/b&gt; This is one part of the PFT test which measures lung size and how fast a patient can breathe air in and out.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Arterial Blood Gas (ABG):&lt;/b&gt; This is a blood test taken from an artery of the wrist and measures the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the blood.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exercise &#45; with Arterial Line:&lt;/b&gt; This test monitors lung and heart function and ABG while exercising at gradually increasing workloads to a maximal level.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exercise &#45; with Arterial Line and Screening Protocol for Induced Asthma:&lt;/b&gt; This test measures whether symptoms (shortness of breath, chest tightness, etc.) are triggered by exercise.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exercise &#45; Bloodless:&lt;/b&gt; This test monitors lung and heart function while exercising at gradually increasing workloads to a maximal level.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exercise &#45; Bloodless with Screening Protocol for Induced Asthma:&lt;/b&gt; This test measures whether symptoms (shortness of breath, chest tightness, etc.) are triggered by exercise.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exercise – Bloodless with Formal Protocol for Induced Asthma: &lt;/b&gt; This test is similar to test #7, except that the patient will cycle until reaching a specific heart rate. &lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Oxygen Prescription by Ergometer with Oximetry:&lt;/b&gt; This test measures whether a patient needs additional oxygen to breath normally while exercising on a stationary bicycle. &lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Oxygen Prescription by Ergometer with Arterial Line:&lt;/b&gt; This test measures whether a patient needs additional oxygen to breath normally by drawing blood from an artery in the wrist.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Oxygen Prescription by Walk with Oximetry:&lt;/b&gt; This test measures whether a patient needs additional oxygen to breath normally in patients who are unable to pedal on a stationary bicycle.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methacholine provocation:&lt;/b&gt; This test measures whether a patient's airways are overly sensitive, or hyper reactive (&quot;twitchy&quot;) when breathing a drug called methacholine. This test is one way to evaluate patients for asthma.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Altitude Simulation:&lt;/b&gt; This test is designed to evaluate whether a patient's breathing will be affected by high altitudes (i.e., airplane travel, mountain climbing, and travel to Reno or Tahoe).&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Post&#45;Operative Lung Transplant Evaluation Protocol:&lt;/b&gt; These patients undergo a Pulmonary Function Test and Bronchoscopy.  &lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lung Volume Reduction Evaluation Protocol:&lt;/b&gt; Patients who are being considered for this surgery will undergo a Pulmonary Function Test, Exercise – with Arterial Line, Methacholine Provocation, Oxygen Prescription by Walk with Oximetry, Lung Compliance and Questionnaires.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bronchoscopy:&lt;/b&gt; This procedure involves passing a flexible tube (bronchoscope) through the mouth to enable a view of the larynx, vocal cords, trachea and bronchi of your lungs. &lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Patient Care&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;San Francisco General Hospital has a long history of as a leading center in caring for tuberculosis (TB) patients, dating back to its days as TB sanatorium and later hospital in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The legacy of this tradition of outstanding patient care continues today at the San Francisco Department of Public Health TB Control Program Clinic, located on Ward 94 at San Francisco General Hospital. There, physicians from the UCSF Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care and the Department of Public Health work together to care for patients with suspected and confirmed TB (see www.sftbc.org for hours, location, and general clinic information).&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Consultation, Education, and Technical Assistance&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;San Francisco General Hospital is also home to the Curry International TB Center (http://www.nationaltbcenter.edu/), which is designated as a Regional Tuberculosis Training and Medical Consultation Center through a cooperative agreement with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Curry develops educational curricula; trains doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and public health practitioners; and provides medical consultation, research, and technical assistance to help strengthen health&#45;systems throughout the Western U.S. and internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Research and Policy&#45;making&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Faculty in the Division of Pulmonary &amp; Critical Care Medicine at San Francisco General Hospital have been working to improve global lung health for several years using knowledge gained through research to help develop better health policies. We have advised the U.S. Government, the World Health Organization, the American Thoracic Society, and other international health&#45;professional societies on how best to adopt patient care and public health practices that are based on the latest scientific evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;As pulmonologists, we want to help reduce deaths and complications due to TB, pneumonia, HIV&#45;related lung diseases, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Together these lung diseases explain about one&#45;fifth of the global burden of disease in poor countries, and cause almost 10 million deaths per year. As critical care physicians, we want to help clinicians practicing in areas with financial and other resource constraints to more accurately identify and care for severely ill patients. In whatever we do, domestically or internationally, we try to use the state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art, approaches that draw on the expertise of different team members from the U.S. and from foreign countries, in order to find simple, long&#45;lasting, and patient&#45;oriented solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) ./pulmonary/care/lung_fibrosis.html
		</Fname>
		<Tax>1736</Tax>
		<Path>./pulmonary/care/lung_fibrosis.html</Path>
		<FileBody>

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Interstitial lung diseases (ILD) are a large and diverse group of lung diseases that have similar clinical and pathologic findings, and symptoms. In interstitial lung disease, the lung tissue where the oxygen passes into the blood stream is inflamed and/or scarred, affecting the lung’s ability to provide the body with necessary amounts of oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;What causes Interstitial Lung Disease?&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;There are many causes for inflammation and scarring (fibrosis) of lung tissue. Underlying connective tissue or autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, or myositis can cause inflammation of lung tissue. Some forms of interstitial lung diseases have a genetic cause and run in families. Inhalation of certain proteins, especially from feathers and molds, can also cause inflammation. If inflammation is present in the lung for a long time, scarring of the lung can occur. One of the most common types of interstitial lung disease, called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), is associated with aging and results in scarring of the lung rather than inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/pulmonary.ucsf.edu/files/images/collard_2.jpeg&quot; class=&quot;imgRight&quot;/&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;How is Interstitial Lung Disease Diagnosed?&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Because treatment depends on the specific ILD, an accurate diagnosis is extremely important. Diagnosis of ILD can be difficult and requires input from pulmonologists, radiologists, and in many cases, pathologists, experienced in the evaluation of patients with interstitial lung disease. A face&#45;to&#45;face discussion among experts in these different disciplines (a multidisciplinary case conference) is necessary to establish an accurate diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;In making a diagnosis of ILD, your doctor will conduct a thorough history (medical, environmental, occupational, and family history), as well as a physical examination, including listening to your chest with a stethoscope, and carefully examining your skin and joints.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;In addition, the following tests may be ordered to help make an accurate diagnosis:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Pulmonary Function Testing (PFT).&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;6 Minute Walk Test (6MWT).&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) of the chest.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Blood analysis for autoantibodies, which may suggest presence of a connective tissue disease.
				&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bronchoscopy with Bronchoalveolar lavage

				&lt;li&gt;Video&#45;Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgical Lung Biopsy (VATS biopsy).&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Treatment&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MEDICAL&lt;/strong&gt;:  As mentioned above, treatment depends on the type of interstitial lung disease. Anti&#45;inflammatory or immunosuppressant medications may be recommended to reduce inflammation. It may be necessary to treat an underlying connective tissue disease or other contributory problem such as gastric reflux. If the ILD is thought to be due to an exposure to a protein, identification and removal of that antigen is essential. New antifibrotic therapies are available for for managing idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. In addition we are involved in clinical trials testing novel treatments for pulmonary fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXERCISE&lt;/strong&gt;: Most patients with interstitial lung disease benefit from engaging in a regular exercise program.  This can be done independently or in a formal, structured, pulmonary rehabilitation program.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLINICAL TRIALS&lt;/strong&gt;: . Clinicians at UCSF are actively researching the causes and seeking to develop novel treatments for ILDs. Patients should discuss current opportunities with their doctor and consider participating in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pulmonary.ucsf.edu/research/trials/interstitial.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt;. For more information on clinical trials, please contact &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:Fizaa.Ahmed@ucsf.edu&quot;&gt;Fizaa Ahmed&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;


			&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ILD SUPPORT GROUP&lt;/strong&gt;: Living Well with Interstitial Lung Disease: Patients with ILD meet at UCSF on a monthly basis to discuss personal experiences, and learn more about the causes and management of interstitial lung diseases.  Contact &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:Sally.McLaughlin@ucsf.edu&quot;&gt;Sally McLaughlin&lt;/a&gt; for more information. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;
			Pulmonary Rehabilitation: Empowering Patients through Education, Motivation, Exercise, and Support&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;What is Pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR)?&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary rehabilitation is a multidisciplinary program of care for patients with chronic lung disease. PR includes a medically supervised program of exercise and education, specifically designed for each individual patient to help improve symptoms such as shortness of breath and functional status. It is a fun and interactive learning environment with exercise and education at the center of the program.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;What are the goals of PR?&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The goals of pulmonary rehabilitation are to control or reduce symptoms, improve functional status, educate patients and families about lung disease and self&#45;management strategies, and improve overall quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;What are the components of PR?&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary rehabilitation programs are designed with the individual patient in mind. There are core components of every program including medical management, exercise, self&#45;management education, breathing retraining, and psychosocial support to help patients cope with living with a chronic illness. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Who are the members of the PR team?&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Most PR programs include a multidisciplinary team of providers including physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists, occupational therapists, pharmacists, and nutritionists. The team designs a care program that is individualized for each patient and based on his/her needs. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Who is eligible for PR?&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Patients who have obstructive lung diseases such as COPD, emphysema or chronic bronchitis or those with restrictive lung diseases such as interstitial lung disease (ILD) may be eligible. In addition, patients with sarcoidosis, neuromuscular diseases, lung cancer or those who are preparing for or recovering from lung transplant may also benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;What are the components of PR?&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;There are several core components of a comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation program and these include:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Self management education
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exercise training
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Psychosocial support
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Promotion of patient involvement in his/her long term care plan
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;What type of exercise should I expect?&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary rehabilitation programs tailor the exercise with the individual patient’s needs in mind. Expect to participate in aerobic exercises such as walking or stationary bicycle, strength training exercises, and breathing retraining.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Self management education is a big focus of the program, what will I learn about my lung disease?&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary rehabilitation programs offer a variety of educational opportunities. Some of the common topics include:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Medications and inhaler techniques
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Understanding lung disease
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Living and coping with chronic illness
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Preventing and managing lung infections
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stress management and relaxation exercises
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oxygen equipment and travel with oxygen
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nutrition and health
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Advanced care planning
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;What are the benefits of PR?&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that patients with COPD who participate in pulmonary rehabilitation have decreased shortness of breath, improved activity tolerance, improved quality of life, better mood and reduced hospitalizations.

			 &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Are there other services offered after I complete PR?&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Health maintenance is a lifelong process and patient’s needs change throughout the course of illness. UCSF offers a monthly education and support class, For more information contact  415&#45;476&#45;0984 or &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:dyspnea@ucsf.edu&quot;&gt;dyspnea@ucsf.edu&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To make an appointment:&lt;/strong&gt; UCSF offers pulmonary rehabilitation to UCSF patients referred by their UCSF lung specialist. The program is located at 2330 Post St., Suite 420. For more information, please call 415&#45;885&#45;7755.&lt;/p&gt;

Sarcoidosis ./pulmonary/care/sarcoidosis.html

		<Path>./pulmonary/care/sarcoidosis.html</Path>
		<FileBody>

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;
			What do we currently know about sarcoidosis?&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Sarcoidosis is thought to be a systemic inflammatory disease that affects the lungs in up to 80&#45;90% of affected individuals. Thus, some individuals do not have lung involvement but involvement in other organs of the body (eyes, nervous system, lymph nodes, skin, liver, spleen, joints, are some examples of other organs that can be involved)
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;One of the main motivations of our group is to understand sarcoidosis better since there are so many remaining questions. However, research thus far has revealed some important facts about sarcoidosis. First, the cause of sarcoidosis is likely complex, involving some sort of trigger, which most investigators believe may be environmental, but also involves genetic risk factors. Both of the areas are currently being investigated. Results from the largest epidemiologic study to date (the ACCESS trial), revealed that there is no one unifying environmental trigger and no one single gene mutation responsible to causing sarcoidosis. Thus, the disease is thought to be a complex genetic disease with an environmental component.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;What are common symptoms?&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Since the majority of subjects have sarcoidosis in their lungs or lymph nodes in their chest, respiratory of chest symptoms are the most common symptoms. Other symptoms that can be frustrating, debilitating and difficult to treat include symptoms of fatigue, joint pain, and vague chest pains. Some subjects, however, have no symptoms at all. Since sarcoidosis can appear in any organ, subjects may have symptoms specific to their affected organ.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;When a new symptom arises, it is important to inform your treating physician. The new symptom may or may not be related to sarcoidosis so communication and evaluation is always a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;How is sarcoidosis diagnosed?&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Sarcoidosis can be challenging to diagnose as no single diagnostic test currently exists. Doctors will often take a thorough clinical history, obtain a high&#45;resolution chest CT scan, and ultimately, recommend a biopsy of the affected organ in order to diagnose sarcoidosis. Finally, the doctor should also perform additional tests to exclude other diseases that can mimic sarcoidosis.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;What are current approaches in treating sarcoidosis?&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The first important issue to discuss with your doctor is whether treatment is necessary at all. Because sarcoidosis can resolve without therapy, it is important to hold off on therapy if at all possible. Once the decision to treat sarcoidosis is made, the mainstay of treatment is corticosteroids (often prednisone). The treatment typically lasts for 6 months or longer, but length of treatment depends on what organs are involved and whether there is a relapse of symptoms. Sometimes it is necessary to add a steroid&#45;sparing medication (such as methotrexate or azathioprine) in order to be able to decrease the dose of prednisone and minimize the side effects caused by prednisone.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h4&gt;Faculty&lt;/h4&gt;

Lung Transplant ./pulmonary/care/transplant.html
		</Fname>
		<Tax>1736</Tax>
		<Path>./pulmonary/care/transplant.html</Path>
		<FileBody>

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;
			Lung transplantation is the most advanced treatment for patients with severe diseases of the lung, such as emphysema, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension, to name a few. &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Since its establishment in 1991, the UCSF Lung Transplant program has grown to one of the largest lung transplant programs in the country.  We have performed nearly 500 transplants total with 40 to 50 new transplants performed every year.  Lung transplant remains a field with great opportunity for improved outcomes, and we are rapidly expanding our research programs in lung transplantation to accomplish this goal. Our average survival rate is not only higher than the national average, it is also higher than what is predicted for our program, given the complexity of our patients. We will continue to push the envelope in improving patient outcomes through our research and program development.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Who is a candidate for Lung Transplantation?&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The most common diagnoses have been:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Cystic Fibrosis (CF)&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Idiopathic Pulmonary Arterial Hyertension (PAH)&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Eisenmenger’s syndrome&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Emphysema due to Alpha&#45;1 Antitrypsin Deficiency&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Other less common indications have included:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Bronchiectasis&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Sarcoidosis&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM)&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Pulmonary Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis X&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;In general, patients with advanced pulmonary disease can be considered for lung transplantation if they meet the following guidelines:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Untreatable advanced pulmonary disease of any etiology &lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Absence of other significant medical diseases &lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Substantial limitation of daily activities &lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Limited life expectancy&#45;usually less than 2 years&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Ambulatory patient with rehabilitation potential &lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Acceptable nutritional status &lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Satisfactory psychosocial profile and emotional support system&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;When should one be referred for and listed for Lung Transplantation?&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;In general, a patient should be referred for a lung transplantation evaluation based on functional status and life expectancy. A patient who is short of breath at rest or with minimal exertion or who has an estimated 50% chance of surviving another 2&#45;3 years should be referred for a transplant assessment if there are no obvious contraindications.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;How does the evaluation and listing process work?&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The comprehensive transplant evaluation seeks to determine the ability of the patient to benefit from transplantation and to enjoy a successful outcome with long&#45;term health.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
			&lt;u&gt;Objectives of Evaluation Procedures&lt;/u&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Single lung transplantation&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Double lung transplantation&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Heart&#45;lung transplantation&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Transplantation of lobes from living related donors&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;What are the expected outcomes of Lung Transplantation?&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The outcome of lung transplantation can be assessed by survival and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Survival&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Survival statistics are available by center at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.srtr.org/&quot;&gt;SRTR&lt;/a&gt;.  The most recent report shows that 1 year and 3 year survival at UCSF is 91.5 and 71.4% respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Quality of life&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Several studies have documented a significant improvement in both overall and health&#45;related quality of life after lung transplantation.  In fact, UCSF is actively involved in research &lt;a href=&quot;http://pulmonary&#45;sandbox.ucsf.edu/research/transplantation.html&quot;&gt;Transplantation&lt;/a&gt; to better understand the components that predict whether someone has an improvement in quality of life following transplantation.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Where can I get more information?&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.unos.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;United Network for Organ Sharing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.optn.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Organ Procurement Organizations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;The goal of our program is to train physicians for academic careers in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine. To achieve this goal, we offer 18 months of clinical training in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, followed by 18 or more months of basic or clinical research training. Academic training is accomplished by intensive, personal faculty supervision of trainees in a setting that provides well&#45;equipped clinical and research facilities and an environment that fosters scientific inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;div style=&quot;float:right; padding:10px;&quot;&gt;
				&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/pulmonary.ucsf.edu/files/images/lazarus__stephen.jpg&quot; class=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;
				&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Stephen C. Lazarus, Program Director&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Since the Program began nearly 50 years ago, approximately 80% of our graduates have chosen careers in full&#45;time academic medicine and research. In addition to academic appointments in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, many of our graduates have been Division Chiefs, Department Chairs, and Deans. Our program prepares trainees intellectually and scientifically to compete successfully for extramural funding, as evidenced by the 18 NIH K&#45;awards received by recent graduates over the last 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Education and oversight of Pulmonary and Critical Care Fellows is a high priority for faculty in the Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine Program at UCSF. Only well&#45;established senior faculty have served as Fellowship Director and the Clinical Training Program at UCSF has been directed in turn by John F. Murray, Philip Hopewell, H. Benfer Kaltreider, and Stephen C. Lazarus. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The Training Program in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at UCSF is staffed by 52 full&#45;time faculty involved in the program’s day&#45;to&#45;day operation. Our internationally recognized faculty possess a broad array of clinical and research interests covering the major fields of pulmonary medicine, and lead research programs that are among the best funded in the nation. Some faculty members are engaged exclusively in laboratory&#45;based research, whereas others are committed to clinical activities and investigations. This mix of interests and activities promotes a balanced approach to training. In addition to traditional NIH research grants, UCSF Pulmonary Faculty have received competitive awards from the NHLBI for the Asthma Clinical Research Network, the ARDSnet, the COPD Clinical Research Network, the ILD Network, the AsthmaNet, and the SPIROMICS network.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The Training Program in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine is based in three hospitals: Moffitt&#45;Long Hospital (MLH), San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center (SFVAMC) and San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center (SFGH). Each of these hospitals provides a unique patient population and training environment, and is staffed by full&#45;time UCSF faculty. Residents and Clinical Fellows in Internal Medicine and its subspecialties rotate among the three hospitals. Talmadge King is Chairman of the Department of Medicine at UCSF and oversees the program at all 3 sites.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;During the first year of ACGME training, fellows rotate for 12 months among MLH, SFVAMC and SFGH, where they receive clinical training in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, including a sleep rotation at the UCSF/Mt. Zion Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;During the second year, fellows undertake 6 months of Critical Care Medicine training at MLH and SFGH.  The Critical Care rotations can be scheduled in the first or the second 6 months of the year.  The latter enables fellows in the Clinical Scholars track to take coursework in clinical research design, biostatistics, and epidemiology.  The remainder of the second year and all of the third year are spent in research training.  Although the ACGME requirements for Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine are met at the end of 3 years, most fellows devote at least 3 years to research training.&lt;/p&gt;



			&lt;h5&gt;Mentoring&lt;/h5&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;At the start of training, each Fellow is assigned a mentor who serves as a guide both professionally and personally during the course of the Fellow’s training.  At the beginning of the second year of training, each Fellow chooses a Career Development Committee comprised of 3 or more Faculty members.  These Faculty, along with the Fellow and mentor, meet frequently during the following years to ensure that academic goals, research objectives, and/or clinical work is progressing appropriately with the future success of the Fellow in mind.  In addition, the Program Director meets with each fellow at least twice each year, to solicit their opinion about the training program, and to provide feedback and counseling.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Occupational and Environmental Medicine&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Trainees interested in Occupational and/or Environmental Medicine may choose a training track combined with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://oem.ucsf.edu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Occupational Medicine Residency Program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;As part of this program, the trainee will obtain a Master’s in Public Health through UC Berkeley. Trainees who participate in the program would be board&#45;eligible in Preventive Medicine/Occupational and Environmental Medicine. Funding is available to support trainees who pursue training and research in the area of occupational and/or environmental lung diseases. The Occupational and Environment Medicine program director is Dr. Gina Solomon. Faculty includes UCSF pulmonologists Dr. John Balmes and Dr. Paul Blanc. More details on the Occupational Medicine Residency Program are available from the program website &lt;a href=&quot;http://oem.ucsf.edu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The ICU patient population at MLH includes patients that have undergone major vascular and cardiac surgery, as well as heart, lung, liver, bone marrow, and kidney transplantation. In addition, there are patients from the general medical and surgical services with the usual spectrum of pulmonary and non&#45;pulmonary problems resulting in respiratory, cardiac, and other organ systems failure.  A number of these patients require arterial venous hemofiltration, intra&#45;aortic balloon pump management, and ECMO.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;At SFGH, trauma is the major reason for ICU admission.  The fellows have an opportunity to increase their skills in the diagnosis and management of these complex patients with an emphasis on skills related to mechanical ventilation, hemodynamic monitoring, management of simple and complex cardiac arrhythmias, and procedures such as chronic arterial venous hemofiltration and intra&#45;aortic balloon pump management.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Critical care training is a major emphasis of the training program and qualifies fellows to take the ABIM Critical Care Medicine certification examination.  &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;During the first year of clinical fellowship, the fellows consult on critically ill patients in ICUs in all three hospitals and rotate through the closed units at the SF Vererans Affairs Medical Center and at San Francisco General Hospital.  During the second year Fellows spend 6 months on critical care rotations including 4 months in the Medical&#45;Surgical ICU at MLH, 1 month in the Surgical ICU at SFGH, and 1 month in the Operating Room at MLH.  The latter provides supervised training in intubation and airway management in routine and complicated patients. Also, the fellows become more familiar with a wide variety of surgical patients and have the opportunity to increase their skill in placement of systemic arterial, central venous, and pulmonary arterial catheters and management of anesthetics, sedative/hypnotics, and pressors.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;MLH is a 560&#45;bed tertiary care referral center that serves Northern California and neighboring states. The hospital offers special services and procedures that attract referrals of patients with a variety of difficult diagnostic and therapeutic problems. In addition, the outpatient clinics in General Internal Medicine provide primary care to many persons in the Bay Area. This combination of referral and primary care patient populations provides a well&#45;balanced mix for the training and clinical research programs of the institution.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
			Fellows spend one&#45;third of their first year at MLH, during which they rotate twice through 3 different clinical services:  Pulmonary Consultation Service, Pulmonary Function Laboratory, and the Lung Transplant Service.
			&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h5&gt;Pulmonary Consultation Service&lt;/h5&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The MLH Consultation Service is staffed by one Pulmonary Fellow, a medical resident, medical students, and an attending physician. The Fellows are primarily responsible for performing most of the consultations and for supervising the others. The Attending Physicians make rounds daily and are available at all times. There is no in&#45;house night call for fellows but one fellow is available by telephone or long&#45;range beeper at all times.  Weekend coverage is shared with fellows on the Pulmonary Function Laboratory and Lung Transplant rotations. Fellows may participate in the care of adults with cystic fibrosis and recipients of lung transplants.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;While on the Consultation Service, fellows perform bronchoscopy, bronchoalveolar lavage and biopsy procedures under the immediate supervision of an attending physician.  Fellows also receive training in specialized interventional bronchoscopy, including stent and fiducial placement, needle aspiration/biopsy using endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), and whole lung lavage.  Approximately 75 bronchoscopic procedures are performed each month. Biopsy specimens are reviewed with staff pathologists in the setting of a weekly teaching conference.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The MLH Department of Radiology has long emphasized chest radiology. Interaction between the Pulmonary Consultation Service and Radiology is a firmly established and valuable part of the training programs in both disciplines. Radiographic studies, including standard films, CT scans, PET scans, and magnetic resonance images are reviewed daily with a chest radiologist. In addition, images of special educational merit are viewed and discussed at the weekly Chest Radiology Conference.&lt;/p&gt;


			&lt;h5&gt;Pulmonary Function Laboratory&lt;/h5&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;This is a separate rotation taken by all clinical pulmonary fellows in the first year of training. During this rotation, the fellow performs and interprets tests of pulmonary function. The major emphasis of this rotation is the mastery of advanced pulmonary physiology. In addition, fellows are taught the basic mechanics and logistics of operating a pulmonary function laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Because of the nature of the patient population at MLH, sophisticated studies of respiratory function are often performed. Thus, in addition to standard screening measurements of lung volumes, flows, diffusion, and arterial blood gases, the laboratory performs inhalation&#45;provocation testing, noninvasive and invasive exercise studies, measurements of lung mechanics, and tests of O2 and CO2 responsiveness. All screening studies are interpreted daily by the fellow and attending physician. Tests other than screening studies are performed by the fellow and supervised by an attending physician.  There is no in&#45;house call for fellows and no telephone or beeper call during the week.  The Pulmonary Function Laboratory fellow rotates weekend on call duties with the MLH Consult Service and Transplant fellows.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h5&gt;Lung Transplant Service&lt;/h5&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The UCSF Lung Transplant Service is one of the top 10% in volume in the world, performing approximately 30&#45;40 transplants per year with one&#45;year survival that consistently exceeds national benchmarks.  The Pulmonary Fellows rotate on this multidisciplinary service staffed by Transplant Pulmonologists, Surgeons, Pharmacists, and Nurse Practitioners.  In addition to overseeing the evaluation and management of pre&#45; and post&#45;transplant patients, fellows gain experience in interventional bronchoscopy including transbronchial biopsies, stent placement, and dilatations.  There are specific conferences related to transplant including evaluation for listing, Pathology, and Radiology.  There is no in&#45;house night call for fellows, but one fellow is available by telephone or long&#45;range pager at all times.  The Transplant Fellow rotates weekend coverage with the Pulmonary Consult Service and Pulmonary Function Laboratory fellows.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h5&gt;Intensive Care Unit&lt;/h5&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;There are 5 critical care units at MLH, with a combined total of 76 beds.  The combined Medical&#45;Surgical ICU at MLH is an open unit with 40 beds for critically ill adults. The unit is staffed by fellows in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, residents in Internal Medicine, Anesthesiology and Surgery and by two attending physicians.  First&#45;year Fellows on the Pulmonary Consultation Service see patients in the critical care units as part of this rotation.  Second&#45;year pulmonary fellows rotate through this unit as part of a 6&#45;month critical care training program. Rounds are conducted daily with the attending physician, who is available at all times. As a part of daily rounds, imaging studies on all patients are reviewed with a staff radiologist. During the ICU rotation, fellows acquire experience and training in airway management, ventilator management, and insertion of systemic and pulmonary arterial catheters.  In addition to the Medical&#45;Surgical ICU, fellows rotate through critical care units devoted primarily to Neurology/Neurosurgery, and Cardiology and Cardiothoracic Surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Approximately 180 patients are admitted to the ICU each month. These include patients who have had cardiac surgery or other complicated surgical procedures as well as many medical patients. Approximately 80% of patients require mechanical ventilation and 70% require invasive hemodynamic monitoring. There are morning ICU seminars four days per week.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h5&gt;Sleep Disorders Center&lt;/h5&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;All fellows participate in didactic session and receive hands&#45;on training in the diagnosis and treatment of sleep&#45;related disorders at the Sleep Disorders Center at Mt. Zion Hospital (which is part of the Moffitt&#45;Long Division) under the direction of David Claman, M.D. and Ted Omachi, M.D.  Fellows gain additional experience in performance and interpretation of sleep studies during consultation services at the VA Medical Center and the San Francisco General Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Upon joining the Fellowship Program, each Fellow is assigned to an outpatient General Pulmonary Continuity Clinic at one of the three hospitals and continues in that assigned clinic for the duration of her/his training.  Each clinic meets one half day per week and is staffed by Pulmonary Attendings who are always available and who review each case.  At SFGH the fellow on the Consultation Service also sees patients in the Tuberculosis Clinic one half day each week.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A number of disease&#45;specific pulmonary clinics are available, including those devoted to Asthma, Cystic Fibrosis, Interstitial Lung Disease, HIV, TB, Pulmonary Hypertension, Lung Cancer, and Lung Transplant. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The ICU patient population at MLH includes patients that have undergone major vascular and cardiac surgery, as well as heart, lung, liver, bone marrow, and kidney transplantation. In addition, there are patients from the general medical and surgical services with the usual spectrum of pulmonary and non&#45;pulmonary problems resulting in respiratory, cardiac, and other organ systems failure.

		<FileBody>
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;The program provides training in basic and clinical sciences important to the respiratory system and depends on the interdisciplinary staff of the Cardiovascular Research Institute, together with special basic and clinical research skills of other members of the UCSF campus.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The UCSF Pulmonary Research Training Program has been in existence since 1958 and has been funded in part by a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Multidisciplinary Research Training Program Grant (HL&#45;07185) for more than three decades. The grant accommodates a total of thirteen postdoctoral trainees, including both MDs and PhDs and is under the direction of Jay Nadel, M.D. The Research Training Program includes a total of approximately 60 trainees; in addition to the NIH Training Grant, fellowship funds are derived from multiple government and private sources. The NIH Research Training Grant undergoes national peer review every five years, and was successfully renewed in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The program provides research training in bench and clinical sciences important to the respiratory system. The main focus is an actual experience in the &quot;laboratory&quot; (broadly defined) under faculty supervision, and employing approaches applicable at the molecular, cellular, tissue, organ, whole animal, or clinical level. Special educational opportunities have been created to prepare individuals for careers in academic medicine. The education program provides special courses, small group conferences, seminars (including ethics), and personal instruction specifically designed for trainees, as well as bench science courses (including cell biology, biochemistry, and molecular biology), and clinical research courses (epidemiology and biostatistics). The program is designed to provide a broad knowledge of modern scientific investigation, and to increase the writing and teaching skills of trainees who will spend a lifetime as members of a medical school faculty.  Each fellow meets with Dr. Nadel early in the first year, to discuss his/her research interests and to help identify potential research mentors.  Subsequently, with the help of a Career Development Committee (comprised of faculty chosen by each fellow), Dr. Nadel carefully monitors the progress and satisfaction of the trainees and guarantees that at least 80 percent of the trainee’s time is devoted to research.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A UCSF Pulmonary Research Retreat is held annually in the Fall. The goal of the retreat is to provide fellows a broad overview of the many opportunities in research at UCSF.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Training in Bench Investigation&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Due to the dramatic advances in cell and molecular biology, the training program has pursued several approaches to incorporate the disciplines of &quot;modern&quot; biology and genetics. PhDs have been recruited at the faculty level who can train pulmonary fellows and collaborate with the physician&#45;scientists in the program. Collaborations have been developed with basic scientists in other programs and departments throughout the UCSF community.  Faculty and trainees have been encouraged to participate in new courses. The net effect of these three approaches has been to infuse the training program with state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art technology and to integrate more closely the basic and clinical sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A broad range of research opportunities in molecular and cellular biology of lung diseases are available and can be accessed online via the Biosketches of the Program Faculty as well as the Biosketches of the Faculty in the UCSF Program in Biological Sciences (PIBS). Currently, these include investigations of airway inflammation; regulation of surfactant proteins; proteases; mast cell growth, phenotype, and secretion; neuropeptides and neurogenic inflammation; lung injury and repair, stress&#45;induced proteins; ion transport in airway epithelium; cellular and molecular biology of cystic fibrosis; mucin gene regulation; regulation of airway secretion; adhesion molecules; inflammatory cells and mediators in pleural disease; transmembrane signaling in smooth muscle; and pulmonary immune responses, angiogenesis and lung carcinogenesis. In addition, active programs in transcriptional profiling and genetic analysis of asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, and emphysema in both humans and murine models have been recently established at UCSF. UCSF also enjoys a rich array of basic science programs not listed above which may be of special interest to individual Fellows. The Program Faculty will assist all Fellows in selecting a research program tailored to an individual’s interests and experience.  Of note, although each Fellow’s research program should have relevance to Pulmonary Disease, it need not be tied to a member of the Pulmonary Division.&lt;/p&gt;


			&lt;h3&gt;Training in Clinical Investigation (Clinical Scholars Program)&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Clinical and Translational Research is a well&#45;established and valued part of the UCSF program, and the range of research opportunities for Clinical Scholars is almost as broad as that for bench investigation.  Faculty have built upon their prior existing programs to compete successfully for NHLBI funding for clinical research networks, and UCSF investigators have been awarded funding for the Asthma Clinical Research Network, the COPD Clinical Research Network, the ARDS Network, the Interstitial Lung Disease Network, and AsthmaNet.  Substantial space and resources are devoted to these clinical research programs that form the infrastructure for expanded clinical research in these and other lung disease areas.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Trainees may choose a pathway in advanced clinical research and investigation as a Clinical Scholar. The Pulmonary Clinical Scholars Program is coordinated with the clinical scholar training from other fellowships in an interdisciplinary UCSF&#45;sponsored program (Advanced Training in Clinical Research). Each trainee completes core courses in clinical research design, ethics, scientific writing, and statistical methods. The trainee also pursues a supplemental didactic curriculum tailored to her/his specific research goals with the guidance of a primary clinical investigator advisor and a faculty advisory committee. The trainee pursues specific clinical research projects in parallel with all didactic training; possible areas of study include advanced pulmonary physiology, clinical trials, natural history studies, medical ethics, meta&#45;analysis, health services research, survey research, and other epidemiological investigations.  Well&#45;developed programs exist in Asthma, COPD, Cystic Fibrosis, ARDS/ALI, Interstitial Lung Disease, Tuberculosis, HIV, Lung Transplant, Sleep Disorders, effects of Tobacco Smoke, Medical Ethics/end of life decisions, and Health Outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Those interested in clinical research may also choose a joint training track combined with the Occupational Medicine Residency Program (see Additional Training Options above).&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;SFGH is a 382&#45;bed acute care hospital that is fully integrated into the UCSF teaching program. As a public hospital with the most active emergency service in the city, it admits large numbers of acutely ill patients. The spectrum of patients at SFGH is representative of that commonly encountered in a City/County institution. Most patients are admitted because of an acute illness rather than electively. These illnesses include infectious diseases, severe asthma, drug overdoses, complicated pleural problems and pulmonary complications of HIV infection. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Fellows spend one&#45;third of their first year at SFGH, during which they rotate twice through 3 different clinical services:  Pulmonary Consultation and Diagnostic Service, Medical ICU (MICU).&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Consultation and Diagnostic Service&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The SFGH Pulmonary Consultation Service is staffed by one&#45;two Fellows and an Attending Physician. Often there is a senior Internal Medicine resident and a medical student on the service as well. The fellow is responsible for organizing the daily activities of the service and for immediate supervision of the resident and student. Approximately 50 new consultations are seen each month. In addition, approximately 60 patients per month with known or suspected HIV infection undergo screening evaluations for respiratory complaints. The majority of these latter patients do not require full consultation or bronchoscopic procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;There are daily rounds with the attending physician, who is available at all times. Fellows do not take in&#45;house call, but are available by telephone or pager. In addition, there are daily rounds with an attending chest radiologist to review all radiographic studies performed on patients being seen by the Consultation Service and all patients in the Medical ICU. There is a very close working relationship between the Department of Radiology at SFGH and the Consultation and ICU services. While on the consultation service the fellow is responsible for performing bronchoscopies under the immediate supervision of an attending physician. Approximately 30 bronchoscopic procedures are performed each month. Biopsies are reviewed on a regular basis with staff pathologists, and there are weekly pathology and surgical conferences.  The fellows are responsible for performing special studies of lung function and for interpreting all routine pulmonary function tests and screening sleep studies. These studies are reviewed daily with an attending physician.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Medical Intensive Care Unit&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;During the consult months, the pulmonary fellows are responsible for consultation in the Medical ICU. The ICU is staffed by four senior Medical Residents and an attending physician.  Primary responsibility for patient care remains with the ward housestaff team and they are supervised in all aspects of patient care by the ICU resident and attending who is the physician of record for each patient admitted to the unit. There are approximately 50 admissions each month. Of these, approximately 50% require mechanical ventilation and approximately 30% undergo invasive hemodynamic monitoring. Unit rounds are scheduled twice a day. The attending physician is available at all times. The fellow also spends time with Respiratory Therapists learning details of ventilators and of overall operation of a Respiratory Therapy Department.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary and Critical Care Fellows also spend 1 month of their first year assigned full&#45;time to the MICU.  During this month fellows are responsible for care of patients with diverse medical problems leading to single or multi&#45;organ dysfunction and failure including: severe sepsis, septic shock, respiratory failure, hepatic failure, renal failure, drug toxicity, cardiac dysfunction, and central nervous system dysfunction.  In addition, they supervise an ICU team of 4 senior internal medicine residents, 3 internal medicine interns, and 1 family practice second&#45;year resident.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Outpatient Consultation Service&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The Consultation Service fellows and attending physician are available daily to see outpatients for whom consultation is requested, usually from 1&#45;3 PM. Consultations are received from a variety of community and SFGH clinics and are answered within one working day.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;The San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center (SFVAMC) is a 250&#45;bed facility that is an integral part of the UCSF teaching and research programs. The hospital serves as the major referral center for outpatient VA clinics in Northern California and Nevada. Due to the nature of the population served, there are a large number of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and asthma as well as interstitial lung diseases, pleural disorders, sleep disorders, pulmonary infections and AIDS, and pulmonary vascular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The two clinical rotations for first&#45;year pulmonary fellows at VAMC are:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Pulmonary Consultation Service&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Working one&#45;on&#45;one with an attending pulmonary physician, fellows on this rotation serve as inpatient consultants for the Medical and Surgical Services. In addition, they provide rapid turn&#45;around evaluations in ambulatory care for patients referred for lung cancer and receive intensive instruction in performing bronchoscopic procedures including bronchoalveolar lavage, transbronchial, airway mucosal, and bronchoscopic fine needle biopsies, and endobronchial ultrasound&#45;guided bioposies. At weekly meetings, biopsies are reviewed with a pathologist, and diagnostic and therapeutic approaches are discussed at a Medical&#45;Surgical&#45;Oncologic Chest Conference. Fellows also receive instruction in interpretation of chest imaging studies from a chest radiologist and are responsible for reviewing sleep and pulmonary function studies.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;ICU Team&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Under a new closed&#45;unit model, the ICU Team provides comprehensive care for MICU patients and participates actively and daily in the care of SICU patients. Two faculty members serve as attendings at all times, usually a pulmonologist and a surgeon or anesthesiologist. The pulmonary fellow on this rotation works with UCSF medical, surgical, and anesthesiology residents to provide a multidisciplinary approach to the care of these patients.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Philanthropy plays a critical role in supporting the activities of the UCSF Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine Division. Your gift to the Division will allow us to deliver upon our commitment to excellence.&lt;/p&gt;




			&lt;p&gt;Nothing is more basic to human life than breathing. Diseases that impact individuals’ ability to perform this vital function – including lung and respiratory disorders – exact an enormous toll upon human welfare, affecting millions of people and amounting to billions of dollars in direct and indirect costs in the United States alone. Globally, respiratory illnesses represent the single most burdensome disease category. To date, there are no known cures for these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The division is poised to meet the growing need for its expertise. A recent generous donor bequest presented the division with a unique opportunity to build upon its past successes and secure a future full of promise for people everywhere who are coping with lung disease. Leveraging the momentum generated by this gift, we seek additional private philanthropy to help us consolidate and expand our facilities, develop and retain outstanding faculty and researchers, and create highly specialized “cores,” available to researchers across campus, that foster innovative collaborations. The opportunity to help save lives has never been greater.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;How You Can Help&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;There are a variety of ways to support the Division, including planned giving options. You may direct your gift to a specific program or research area, or you can give to the Division’s Opportunity Fund, to support the most pressing needs of the Department, as determined by the Chief. For further information about giving please contact Olivia Herbert, Director of Development, Department of Medicine, at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:OHerbert@support.ucsf.edu&quot;&gt;OHerbert@support.ucsf.edu&lt;/a&gt; or (415) 476&#45;9878.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h2&gt;Donor Profile: Nina Ireland&lt;/h2&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;&quot;Endowment Opens unique Opportunity for Pulmonary medicine at UCSF&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/pulmonary.ucsf.edu/files/images/nina.jpg&quot; class=&quot;imgLeft&quot; style=&quot;margin&#45;bottom:10px;&quot;/&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The Nina Ireland Lung Disease Program was established in 2010, when Nina Ireland, a longtime patient of UCSF pulmonologist Jeffrey Golden, MD, left nearly her entire estate to UCSF to establish an endowment supporting pulmonary medicine. The Ireland bequest – the largest ever bequeathed to UCSF (and believed to be the largest gift ever made to pulmonary medicine) – provides an unprecedented, stable source of restricted income that will help the division to fully realize its great potential.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The Nina Ireland Lung Disease Program (NILDP), focuses in four thematic areas: Lung Transplantation, ILD, Lung Diseases of Underserved Populations, and Pulmonary Rehabilitation. In its first year, the NILDP added three new faculty members, supported enhanced training for 12 research fellows, helped six junior faculty establish independent laboratories, created an invaluable bio&#45;repository that combines clinical data and biospecimens from large groups of lung disease patients, expanded UCSF’s clinical program in ILD, and supported competitive grants for innovative research.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;Nina Ireland Program for Lung Health&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The Nina Ireland Program for Lung Health was established in 2010 with a bequest left by Nina Ireland to the UCSF Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine. Under the direction of Dr. Jeffrey Golden, the goals of the program are to support the overall advancement of lung health worldwide, with a particular focus on pulmonary fibrosis, lung transplant, interstitial lung disease, pulmonary rehabilitation, and care for the underserved.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;div id=&quot;button3&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;button3&quot; href=&quot;https://makeagift.ucsf.edu/site/SPageServer?pagename=A1_API_CustomGivingForm&amp;Primary=Division%20of%20Pulmonary&amp;ACode=U5126&quot;&gt;Make a Gift&lt;/a&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;Jay A. Nadel Distinguished Professorship in support of Junior Faculty in the Pulmonary and Critical Care Division&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;This Fund, in honor of the former Chief of the division, exists as an endowment and supports the research efforts of the most talented junior faculty in the Pulmonary Division. It provides essential funds that ensure promising young scientists are able to execute research that is changing the way we treat patients with lung diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;div id=&quot;button3&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;button3&quot; href=&quot;https://makeagift.ucsf.edu/site/SPageServer?pagename=A1_API_CustomGivingForm&amp;Primary=Division%20of%20Pulmonary&amp;ACode=S0441&quot;&gt;Make a Gift&lt;/a&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;John F. Murray Distinguished Professorship in Pulmonary Medicine&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;he Murray Distinguished Professorship, in honor of Dr. John F Murray, will
			support a top physician in perpetuity at San Francisco General Hospital
			and help to underwrite his or her teaching and research activities.&lt;/p&gt;


			&lt;div id=&quot;button3&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;button3&quot; class=&quot;button3&quot; href=&quot;https://makeagift.ucsf.edu/site/SPageServer?pagename=A1_API_CustomGivingForm&amp;Primary=Division%20of%20Pulmonary&amp;ACode=B3189&quot;&gt;Make a Gift&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;Division’s Opportunity Fund&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The Division Opportunity Fund allows the division maximal flexibility to rapidly respond to new opportunities in any area of pulmonary biology and medicine. This fund is used to make targeted investments in people and programs critical to maintain our position as the world's leading center in pulmonary research, training and clinical care.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;div id=&quot;button3&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;button3&quot; href=&quot;https://makeagift.ucsf.edu/site/SPageServer?pagename=A1_API_CustomGivingForm&amp;Primary=Division%20of%20Pulmonary&amp;ACode=B3188
			 &quot;&gt;Make a Gift&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Interstitial Lung Disease&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The UCSF Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) program is dedicated to improving the lives of patients with ILD, the scarring of lungs from mold, gas, dust, fumes, autoimmune disease, and (often) unknown causes. For years, UCSF has been a leader in accurately diagnosing and caring for patients with ILD. Because current drug treatments for ILD are inadequate, faculty in the Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy, and Sleep Medicine Division plan and participate in most major clinical trials for ILD patients. We are also at the forefront of basic research in ILD, and with a large federal grant, are developing novel treatments based upon our basic science discoveries. Our team includes pulmonologists, radiologists, pathologists, nurses, and other staff members with ILD expertise. The UCSF ILD program has grown dramatically in the last five years, with approximately 300 new&#45;patient visits each year. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;div id=&quot;button3&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;button3&quot; href=&quot;https://makeagift.ucsf.edu/site/SPageServer?pagename=A1_API_CustomGivingForm&amp;Primary=Division%20of%20Pulmonary&amp;ACode=B3187&quot;&gt;Make a Gift&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;Chronic Airway Disease&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;At the UCSF Airway Clinical Research Center (ACRC), UCSF clinicians and investigators are greatly expanding our understanding of asthma and COPD. With an infrastructure that facilitates integration between laboratory and clinical endeavors, the ACRC is an excellent model for the division’s growing programs in translational medicine. The center’s innovative research initiatives have garnered an unprecedented success rate in NIH grant awards and continue to attract industry partners interested in new treatments for asthma and COPD.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;div id=&quot;button3&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;button3&quot; href=&quot;https://makeagift.ucsf.edu/site/SPageServer?pagename=A1_API_CustomGivingForm&amp;Primary=Division%20of%20Pulmonary&amp;ACode=B3220&quot;&gt;Make a Gift&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;Acute Lung Injury&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Acute lung injury (ALI) is a syndrome that causes shortness of breath and often necessitates mechanical ventilation. Pneumonia, viral infections, sepsis, aspiration, and trauma are among the causes of ALI, which kills as many Americans annually as do breast, colon, and prostate cancer combined. UCSF has a rich history of research on ALI. UCSF investigations have led to gentler lung ventilation protocols and demonstrated beneficial effects of stem cell therapies in animal models and human lungs.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;div id=&quot;button3&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;button3&quot; href=&quot;https://makeagift.ucsf.edu/site/SPageServer?pagename=A1_API_CustomGivingForm&amp;Primary=Division%20of%20Pulmonary&amp;ACode=B3221&quot;&gt;Make a Gift&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;Global Lung Health&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Lung disease — especially infectious illnesses like tuberculosis and pneumonia — is on the rise across the globe. UCSF’s pulmonary experts are part of a large, multidisciplinary initiative to address the world’s most daunting health challenges, including lung and breathing disorders that result from infection, environmental insults, and the global AIDS epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;div id=&quot;button3&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;button3&quot; href=&quot;https://makeagift.ucsf.edu/site/SPageServer?pagename=A1_API_CustomGivingForm&amp;Primary=Division%20of%20Pulmonary&amp;ACode=B3226&quot;&gt;Make a Gift&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;Lung Transplant&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Since the establishment of the Lung Transplant program in 1991, we have performed more than 340 transplants. Today, these procedures number between 40 and 50 each year. Lung transplant remains a field with great opportunity for improved outcomes, and we are rapidly expanding our research programs in lung transplantation. Our survival rate is currently 6&#45;7 years for 50 percent of our patients, who represent some of the most complicated cases; this is superior to the national average of 5.5 years, and we expect our numbers will continue to improve.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;div id=&quot;button3&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;button3&quot; href=&quot;https://makeagift.ucsf.edu/site/SPageServer?pagename=A1_API_CustomGivingForm&amp;Primary=Division%20of%20Pulmonary&amp;ACode=B3227&quot;&gt;Make a Gift&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Sleep Medicine&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The UCSF Sleep Center includes practitioners and researchers who are leaders in identifying the causes of sleep disorders, including sleep apnea, a common disruption of breathing during sleep. Our clinicians and scientists are helping patients sleep more soundly, while they investigate new therapies for this condition.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;div id=&quot;button3&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;button3&quot; href=&quot;https://makeagift.ucsf.edu/site/SPageServer?pagename=A1_API_CustomGivingForm&amp;Primary=Division%20of%20Pulmonary&amp;ACode=B3222
			 &quot;&gt;Make a Gift&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Cystic Fibrosis&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;At the UCSF Adult Cystic Fibrosis Center, we provide comprehensive evaluation as well as inpatient and outpatient care for patients with cystic fibrosis. Our services include diagnosis, care coordination, nutritional assessment and counseling, symptom management, and evaluation for lung transplantation.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;div id=&quot;button3&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;button3&quot; href=&quot;https://makeagift.ucsf.edu/site/SPageServer?pagename=A1_API_CustomGivingForm&amp;Primary=Division%20of%20Pulmonary&amp;ACode=B3223&quot;&gt;Make a Gift&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Allergy&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The lungs are the first line of defense against external antigens. Tapping into UCSF’s preeminence in basic and applied immunology, UCSF researchers are helping us gain a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of allergies.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;div id=&quot;button3&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;button3&quot; href=&quot;https://makeagift.ucsf.edu/site/SPageServer?pagename=A1_API_CustomGivingForm&amp;Primary=Division%20of%20Pulmonary&amp;ACode=B3224&quot;&gt;Make a Gift&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Lung Cancer&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The division conducts basic research into the biochemical mechanisms responsible for lung tumor formation and metastasis. Discoveries in our labs have helped lead to earlier diagnosis and are pointing the way toward treatments that effectively intervene with cancer formation and progression.
			&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;div id=&quot;button3&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;button3&quot; href=&quot;https://makeagift.ucsf.edu/site/SPageServer?pagename=A1_API_CustomGivingForm&amp;Primary=Division%20of%20Pulmonary&amp;ACode=B3225&quot;&gt;Make a Gift&lt;/a&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Sarcoidosis&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Sarcoidosis is thought to be a systemic inflammatory disease that affects the lungs in up to 80&#45;90% of affected individuals. The Sarcoidosis Research Program at the University of California, San Francisco was founded in the fall of 2009. It’s mission is to improve the lives of patients with sarcoidosis through clinical and translational research. Specifically, the program is performing research to: (1) improve our understanding of the how the immune system is working in sarcoidosis; (2) use this information to identify new ways to treat the abnormal immune response in sarcoidosis; (3) identify ways to predict disease progression or remission; (4) understand how sarcoidosis affects different organ systems.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;
			The UCSF Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy, and Sleep Medicine Division is dedicated to the prevention and cure of lung diseases, and improving the outcomes and quality of life for our patients. As we probe the underlying causes and mechanisms of these diseases, the facts remain sobering:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), which includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis, is now the third leading cause of death in the United States, behind heart disease and cancer.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;The total direct and indirect economic cost of lung disease in the United States in 2010 has been estimated at $186 billion.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Respiratory disease is currently the only leading cause of death that has risen in incidence, rather than fallen, in recent decades.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Worldwide, respiratory infections exact a greater health burden than any other single category of disease.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Lung cancer is now the leading cause of cancer death in men and women in the United States.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Pulmonary fibrosis claims as many lives each year as breast cancer.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;There are no curative treatments for asthma, COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, and acute lung injury,&lt;/b&gt; the four most common pulmonary afflictions.

		<FileBody>

			&lt;p&gt;The UCSF Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy, and Sleep Medicine Division is widely recognized as one of the strongest research and training programs in the world. Formed more than 50 years ago, the division has been at the forefront of pulmonary medicine since it was first established as a unique discipline. UCSF is world renowned for its expertise in incorporating cell and molecular biology techniques, many of which were pioneered at UCSF, into the study of lung biology and disease.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;
			Since 1966, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have continuously funded the UCSF Pulmonary training program, which has produced more than 200 pulmonary scientists who currently hold full&#45;time academic positions in universities worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h4&gt; Donor Spotlight&lt;/h4&gt;

			&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/pulmonary.ucsf.edu/files/images/dr&#45;broaddus_dr&#45;jahan.jpg&quot; class=&quot;imgRight&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.simmonsmesotheliomafoundation.org/current_research/&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;The Simmons Mesothelioma Foundation&lt;/a&gt; has generously donated funding to create a two&#45;year postdoctoral fellowship in the laboratory of Dr. Courtney Broaddus.  A match from the Nina Ireland Program in Lung Health has enriched the fellowship further.  This teamwork is helping leverage donation opportunities for the research carried out at UCSF.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The Simmons Mesothelioma Foundation is committed to providing research support aimed at finding a cure for mesothelioma. The Foundation is supported by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.simmonsfirm.com/mesothelioma&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;Simmons Law Firm&lt;/a&gt;, which has represented victims of mesothelioma and asbestos&#45;related disease throughout the country.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The Simmons Fellowship in Mesothelioma Research is designed to support research aimed at reaching patients by linking bench work to clinical trials, under the leadership of Dr. Thierry Jahan.  Drs. Broaddus and Jahan will jointly supervise the fellow in translating bench work into clinical opportunities for patients with this intractable malignancy.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Goals&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;
			Our goal is to provide extensive hands on training in common procedures offered by interventional pulmonologists.  We are also creating a rigorous clinical research program that includes both participation in multi&#45;center trials of new IP devices as well as single center trials of innovative therapeutic techniques in IP. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Procedures:&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Endobronchial Ultrasound Guided Bronchoscopy
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Electromagnetic Navigation Bronchoscopy
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rigid Bronchoscopy
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cryospray ablation techniques
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cryoprobe resection and lung biopsy
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tracheal and bronchial stent placement
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Endobronchial valve placement for BPF
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Argon Plasma Coagulation
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bronchial thermoplasty
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fiducial Placement for radiation therapy
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Medical thoracoscopy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;Research Trials:&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Endobronchial valve placement for persistent BPF
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;LVR Coil placement
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;LVR Valve Placement
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SuperD  EMN registry&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Location&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The IP fellowship training will take place at 2 locations.  The principle location is the Palo Alto Medical Foundation/ El Camino hospital in Mountain View California, which is 45 minutes south of San Francisco.  Approximately 4 days per week will be spent with Dr. Krishna in Mountain View.  One day a week will be spent at the UCSF campus in San Francisco with Dr. Seeley.  &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Faculty&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ganesh Krishna is the fellowship director and Dr. Eric Seeley is the assistant fellowship director.  Dr. Krishna has been a faculty member at Stanford and currently holds a joint appointment between PAMF and UCSF, where he is an associate professor.  Dr. Krishna did extensive training in Germany and has a full IP suite at El Camino hospital. &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Seeley has been a faculty member at UCSF for 5 years and recently did a year of training with Dr. Krishna and is now the Director of IP at UCSF.  &lt;/p&gt;



			&lt;h3&gt;Fellowship&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Duration of Training&lt;/b&gt;:  1 year&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Application Requirements&lt;/b&gt;:  Successful completion of a fellowship in pulmonary and critical care medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Application Process&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Send the following to Dr. Krishna and Dr. Seeley:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h5&gt;Mission&lt;/h5&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;To build and sustain the world’s leading program for pulmonary clinical care, training and research emphasizing innovation and collaborative approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h5&gt;Vision&lt;/h5&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The Nina Ireland Lung Disease program will make long&#45;term investments in the UCSF Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine that support innovative and collaborative activities and allow the division to become the pre&#45;eminent resource for patients, providers, and the biomedical community. Program support will focus on interstitial lung disease and lung transplantation (advanced lung disease), pulmonary rehabilitation and quality of life, and care of the underserved in the Bay Area and abroad (global health).&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Program Staff&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/about/faculty.html?key=a39ece9e73a695e0aa3f25e98e3b801a&amp;name=GOLDEN%2CJEFFREY+A&quot;&gt;Jeffrey A. Golden, MD Program Director&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jeffrey Golden, associate medical director of Lung Transplantation, is a pulmonologist who treats patients with severe lung disease, particularly candidates for lung transplants. In addition, he is director of clinical trials for the Interstitial Lung Disease Program. In 2010, one of Dr. Golden's longtime patients, Nina Ireland, left $48 million — almost her entire estate — to UCSF to create the Nina Ireland Lung Disease Program.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Golden earned a bachelor's degree at Yale University and a medical degree at Washington University in St. Louis in 1972. He completed internal medicine and pulmonary training at UCSF. He completed pulmonary research training at UCSF's Cardiovascular Research Institute where he studied ozone inhalation in humans as a model of asthma. He is a professor of clinical medicine at UCSF.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;On January 15, 2014, The Nina Ireland Program hosted a Celebration Dinner that brought together the family of Nina Ireland, as well as members of the community and field of pulmonary medicine to celebrate the wonderful generosity of Nina Ireland. The event generated two major gifts of $100,000 to help support our “Vision for a Cure” initiative. This vital funding will help the Nina Ireland Program reach its ambitious vision of combating this deadly disease. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/pulmonary.ucsf.edu/files/images/celebrate.png&quot; class=&quot;imgRight&quot;&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Matching gift of $1.25M pledged to UCSF Foundation to establish the Doris F. and Donald E. Fisher Distinguished Professorship in Pulmonary Therapies and Science in the Division of Pulmonary Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
			Seventeen competitive grants have been awarded through the NIPLH, with a total value of nearly $2.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Matching gift of $25,000 for two years pledged in collaboration with The Simmons Mesothelioma Foundation, to provide research support aimed at finding a cure for mesothelioma.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;In 2012, a partnership between Mulago Hospital, Makerere University School of Medicine, the Makerere University&#45;University of California San Francisco (MU&#45;UCSF) Research Collaboration, the MIND&#45;IHOP Study, and the UCSF Nina Ireland Program for Lung Health was formed to renovate the Bronchoscopy Suite at Mulago Hospital in Kampala, Uganda. The renovated suite includes a negative&#45;pressure air filtration system to provide greater protection to healthcare personnel performing bronchoscopy and a video projection system to facilitate the training of the next generation of Ugandan pulmonologists and nurses. In September 2012, Dr. Jeffrey Golden accompanied Dr. Laurence Huang, Principal Investigator of the MIND&#45;IHOP Study, to dedicate the Bronchoscopy Suite at Mulago Hospital and to start a program to train 5 Ugandan physicians to perform bronchoscopy and 11 nurses to assess and monitor patients during bronchoscopy.&lt;/p&gt;

Nina Ireland Program for Lung Health ./pulmonary/ireland/index.html

			&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/pulmonary.ucsf.edu/files/images/nina.jpg&quot; class=&quot;imgRight&quot; style=&quot;margin&#45;bottom:10px;&quot;/&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;The Mission of the Nina Ireland Program for Lung Health (NIPLH) is to build and sustain the world’s leading program for pulmonary clinical care, training and research emphasizing innovation and collaborative approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The Nina Ireland Program for Lung Health was established in 2010, when Nina Ireland, a long&#45;time patient of Dr. Jeffrey Golden, bequeathed her entire estate to Dr. Golden to establish an endowment supporting pulmonary medicine. The Ireland bequest is believed to be the largest bequest ever given to pulmonary medicine and provides the Division of Pulmonary at UCSF with an unparalleled source of unrestricted income. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Since it’s inception the NIPLH’s main focus has been on four thematic pulmonary areas: Lung Transplantation, Interstitial Lung Disease, Care of the Underserved Populations (Locally and Globally), and Pulmonary Rehabilitation. In it’s first year, the Nina Ireland Program for Lung Health has recruited three new faculty members, funded five junior faculty to help establish research laboratories, supported over a dozen Pulmonary &amp; Critical Care Research Fellows, created a biospecimen repository and lung transplant core that provides clinical data from large groups of lung disease patients and established a very successful innovative grants program that allocates over $500,000 a year in competitive grants.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;In 2013, the Nina Ireland Community Advisory Board was formed to help guide and promote the mission of the NIPLH, develop and implement short and long term goals of the program and help raise additional financial support. The Community Advisory Board is comprised of members from the San Francisco community as well as physicians from UCSF and other medical institutions. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The first initiative derived from the NIPLH Community Board is the “Vision for a Cure” for Pulmonary Fibrosis (PF). Pulmonary fibrosis, also called Interstitial Lung Disease, is essentially scarring of the lung; it is one of the world’s most terminal diseases. This disease affects over five million people worldwide and currently there are no approved treatments to slow, cure, or reverse its advancement. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Over the last decade physician scientists and basic researchers at UCSF have worked together to learn more about the mechanisms and cause of this disease. Together the Pulmonary Division and the NIPLH are uniquely positioned to work towards this “&lt;a href=&quot;/sites/pulmonary.ucsf.edu/files/docs/vision_cure.pdf&quot;&gt;Vision for a Cure&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

			  &lt;h5&gt;Duration and Transferability of the Award&lt;/h5&gt;

			  &lt;p&gt;Since this is the final year of the K12, the scholar that will be appointed in 2017 will be eligible for only one year of support. The K12 is an institutional career development award granted to UCSF, and it is non&#45;transferable.
			&lt;/p&gt;

			  &lt;h5&gt;Professional Effort Devoted to the Program and Source of Funding&lt;/h5&gt;

			  &lt;p&gt;At least 75% of a Scholar's full&#45;time effort must be devoted to the K12 award for the training and research activities. The K Scholar's home department is responsible for covering the remainder (if any) of the Scholar's effort and any salary above $100,000.&lt;/p&gt;

			  &lt;h5&gt;Didactic Training&lt;/h5&gt;

			  &lt;p&gt;All Scholars will be expected to participate in courses, workshops, and scientific meetings in disciplines relevant to their career development plans at UCSF and at other institutions; these should be planned in discussions with mentors and K12 advisors. K12 Scholars may use their K12 research and training funds for such courses, workshops, and meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

			  &lt;h5&gt;Mentors&lt;/h5&gt;

			  &lt;p&gt;Developing a successful clinical research career requires strong relationships with mentors and a research team. Each Scholar must have a lead mentor. Scholars are strongly encouraged to work closely with at least one other mentor from a different discipline. Mentors should have sufficient independent research support to cover the costs of the proposed research project that exceed the limited scholar research funds provided by the K12.&lt;/p&gt;

			  &lt;p&gt;Lead mentors will have overall responsibility for helping Scholars develop creative and independent careers in research. In addition to being an expert in the scientific area the Scholar has chosen to pursue, a lead mentor must be familiar with faculty and resources at UCSF, and have resources and research staff that can support the Scholar's research. Lead mentors will provide guidance to assure that projects are moving satisfactorily on the path to presentations, publications, and grant applications, and they will provide advice about career directions, national networking, and academic promotion. They will also help to assure that 75% of the Scholar's total work week is protected from clinical and administrative duties, and fully available for training and research. Co&#45;mentors will be responsible for working with the lead mentor on these responsibilities, and will provide guidance in one or more complementary areas of expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

			  &lt;h5&gt;Annual NHLBI Pulmonary Omics K12 meetings&lt;/h5&gt;

			  &lt;p&gt;Scholars will be required to participate in annual meetings of all NHLBI K12 programs. K12 program funds will be available for travel to these meetings. This provides an opportunity for the scholars to meet colleagues from across the nation and present their work.&lt;/p&gt;

			  &lt;h5&gt;Supporting Pulmonary Omics Research Training at UCSF&lt;/h5&gt;

			  &lt;p&gt;Scholars are expected to contribute pulmonary omics training of UCSF students, trainees and faculty by participating in seminars and teaching methods to others in the K program and in other affiliated programs such as the UCSF Multidisciplinary Training Program in Lung Disease postdoctoral training program.&lt;/p&gt;

			  &lt;h5&gt;Scholar individual development plans, progress reports, and performance feedback&lt;/h5&gt;

			  &lt;p&gt;Scholars will assemble a mentoring committee of 3&#45;4 faculty that includes 1) the lead mentor, 2) one of the K12 program directors or another member of the K12 Advisory Committee, 3) a senior faculty member who is active in pulmonary research, and 4) a senior faculty member with expertise in omics or related disciplines (e.g., biostatistics or bioinformatics). The Scholar will prepare a written Individual Development Plan (IDP) and meet with the mentoring committee twice annually. Each scholar is also expected to meet periodically with her/his division head/department chair who will oversee the scholar's departmental interactions and academic advancement.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Applications are now being accepted for one new Scholar to begin as soon as possible (not later than January 1, 2018). Applications are due September 1, 2017. Potential applicants should contact one of the program directors (David Erle, &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:David.Erle@ucsf.edu&quot;&gt;David.Erle@ucsf.edu&lt;/a&gt; or Esteban Burchard,
			&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:Esteban.Burchard@ucsf.edu&quot;&gt;Esteban.Burchard@ucsf.edu&lt;/a&gt;) prior to submitting an application.  &lt;/p&gt;


			 &lt;h4&gt;Application&lt;/h4&gt;

			  &lt;p&gt;Before submission, candidates should check with their department chairs to ensure that the department will provide any salary in excess of $100,000 per year that is needed to cover their ≥75% protected time for training and research, as well as salary for any effort not covered by the CTSI. Note that these funds may not be derived from PHS fund sources.&lt;/p&gt;

			  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All applications must include:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			  &lt;ol&gt;
			    &lt;li&gt;Research Plan (3 pages, not including references)&lt;/li&gt;

			    &lt;li&gt;Training Plan (1 page)&lt;/li&gt;

			    &lt;li&gt;Three references from individuals with direct knowledge of the applicants qualifications, including a letter from the individual who served as the applicant's primary mentor during fellowship training&lt;/li&gt;

			    &lt;li&gt;Letter(s) from the proposed mentor(s) indicating support for the applicant's proposal. Letters must specify which research grants or other funding sources will be available to support the research and should document the availability of space and other resources that will be required.&lt;/li&gt;

			    &lt;li&gt;NIH&#45;style biosketches for the applicant and the mentor(s). Mentor biosketches should list research funding support.&lt;/li&gt;

			    &lt;li&gt;A statement from the home department chair (or division head) documenting that the home department understands the conditions of the K12 award and commits to providing necessary resources, including additional salary support if required. For applicants who do not yet have a faculty position, the home department must confirm that the applicant will be appointed as an Assistant Professor on or before the date of appointment as a K12 Scholar.&lt;/li&gt;
			  &lt;/ol&gt;

			  &lt;p&gt;The research plan and training plan should adhere to NIH guidelines on font sizes and margins. Applications and letters of support (in pdf format) should be submitted by e&#45;mail to  &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:Christine.Mok@ucsf.edu&quot;&gt;Christine.Mok@ucsf.edu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h4&gt;Scholar Selection Criteria&lt;/h4&gt;

			  &lt;p&gt;A Committee of K12 Program faculty will review the scholar applications following the model of the NIH peer review process. Selection criteria will focus on the strengths and potential of the candidate to become a leading pulmonary omics investigator based on:&lt;/p&gt;

			  &lt;ol&gt;
			    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Track Record&lt;/strong&gt;: Appropriate prior education and training; high&#45;quality publications&lt;/li&gt;

			    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research Plan&lt;/strong&gt;: Sound research design, feasible approach, addresses an important problem in pulmonary health/disease with a strong emphasis on one or more omics approaches. Due to NHLBI policy, proposals that focus on lung cancer cannot be considered. Applicants may consult the &lt;a href=&quot;http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa&#45;files/RFA&#45;HL&#45;13&#45;023.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NHLBI K12 RFA&lt;/a&gt; for examples of the kinds of research that can be supported.&lt;/li&gt;

			    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training Plan&lt;/strong&gt;: Qualifications and track records of the mentor(s), incorporation of appropriate plans for multidisciplinary education and training, plan for appropriate didactic training. Applicants are encouraged to propose training plans that include both a lead mentor and a co&#45;mentor with complementary expertise.&lt;/li&gt;

			    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resources&lt;/strong&gt;: Tangible commitment and resources provided by the home department/ORU, and suitability of the available clinical and/or laboratory infrastructure and multidisciplinary team.&lt;/li&gt;

			    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Career Potential&lt;/strong&gt;: Global assessment of the likelihood that participation in the K12 program will help the candidate develop a career as an outstanding investigator who will use omics approaches to advance our understanding of lung health and disease&lt;/li&gt;
			  &lt;/ol&gt;

			  &lt;p&gt;Individuals from underrepresented ethnic minority groups are encouraged to apply, and special consideration will be given to individuals in departments and disciplines that have traditionally been under&#45;represented in clinical research.&lt;/p&gt;

			  &lt;h4&gt;Eligibility&lt;/h4&gt;

			  &lt;p&gt;K12 Scholar candidates must:
			  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			  &lt;ul&gt;
			    &lt;li&gt;Be a U.S. Citizen or Permanent Resident; individuals on temporary or student visas are not eligible.&lt;/li&gt;

			    &lt;li&gt;Possess an M.D., Ph.D. or an equivalent degree and complete post&#45;doctoral training prior to appointment as a K12 Scholar. Qualified post&#45;doctoral fellows from UCSF and other institutions are encouraged to apply if they will complete postdoctoral training before the K12 Scholar appointment date.&lt;/li&gt;

			    &lt;li&gt;Be an Assistant Professor at UCSF during the period of K12 support. Postdoctoral fellows and others not currently appointed as an Assistant Professor must show that a UCSF department will appoint them as an Assistant Professor no later than the K12 Scholar appointment date if they are offered K12 support. Individuals who currently hold the title of Assistant Professor at UCSF are eligible to apply. Since individuals already appointed as tenure track or in residence Assistant Professors typically have already been provided with substantial institutional support (including salary support and independent research space), these individuals must demonstrate that K12 mentoring, training, and financial support will fundamentally change the nature of their research program and have a major impact on their ability to become independent. K12 Scholars can be appointed as Assistant Professor in any UCSF faculty series (including the Adjunct Series).&lt;/li&gt;

			    &lt;li&gt;Commit at least 75% effort to the program.&lt;/li&gt;

			    &lt;li&gt;Not be or have been a principal investigator on an NIH R01, or project leader on a subproject of a Program Project (P01), Center (P50, P60, U54), mentored career development grant (K23, K08, K01, etc.), or equivalent non&#45;PHS peer reviewed research grant that is over $100,000 in direct costs per year. May have had support on a NRSA grant (F or T).&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Name: Jonathan Budzik, MD, PhD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			Mentor: Jeffery Cox, PhD&lt;br /&gt;
			Scholar Term: 01/2018 &#45; present
			&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Budzik received his undergraduate degree at Dartmouth College. As an Arnold and Mabel Beckman scholar in the laboratory of Dr. George O'Toole, he discovered a bacteriophage capable of mediating transduction between strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This experience inspired Dr. Budzik to pursue further microbiology training as a MD/PhD student in Dr. Olaf Schneewind's group at the University of Chicago where he studied the mechanism of pilus assembly in Gram&#45;positive bacteria. As an internal medicine resident at UCSF, Dr. Budzik developed a keen interest in M. tuberculosis pathogenesis and completed a translational research project on the association between TB treatment outcomes, pyrazinamide resistance, and bacterial lineage. Dr. Budzik's research during pulmonary and critical care fellowship explored how the innate immune system responds to TB infection.  He serves as an attending physician and associate co&#45;director for the UCSF adult cystic fibrosis clinic.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Tuberculosis is a leading cause of death from infectious disease and new treatments are needed to combat multi&#45;drug resistant isolates. The goal of Dr. Budzik's research is to discover the mechanism of kinase&#45;dependent targeting of M. tuberculosis to autophagy, a process that restricts M. tuberculosis growth in host cells.  We developed an unbiased method to measure global changes in macrophage protein phosphorylation levels during TB infection. We are now studying the role of phosphorylated autophagy proteins in controlling TB infection. A better understanding of the host pathogen interaction will allow for the design of novel host&#45;directed therapies for tuberculosis.
			&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Name: Charles Langelier, MD, PhD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			Mentor: Joseph DeRisi, PhD&lt;br /&gt;
			Scholar Term: 07/2016 &#45; present
			&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Langelier is an Assistant Professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases.  He received a B.A. in Chemistry/Biochemistry from Colby College. Influential experiences in Uganda and Tanzania as a medical student catalyzed a passion for infectious disease medicine and motivated PhD research in the Sundquist laboratory at the University of Utah studying the host&#45;pathogen biochemistry of HIV replication.  Dr. Langelier became involved in patient&#45;oriented translational research during his internal medicine residency and infectious diseases fellowship at UCSF.  His research leverages NGS technology to identify pathogens, evaluate host responses and predict antimicrobial resistance in patients with severe respiratory infections.  Dr. Langelier also studies mechanisms by which environmental exposures modulate respiratory infection severity and susceptibility.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) are the leading infectious cause of death worldwide.  Despite this, the responsible pathogens remain unidentified in most cases due to the limitations of current medical diagnostics.  This can lead to ineffective empiric treatments, excessive broadspectrum antibiotic use and adverse outcomes.  To directly address the need for improved LRTI diagnostics, Dr. Langelier engages next generation sequencing (NGS) technology to understand the microbial causes of severe respiratory infections. By capturing both microbial and human RNA from clinical samples, NGS allows for simultaneous transcriptional profiling of both microbial genomes and host immunologic responses. This enables precision diagnosis to inform treatments and target antibiotic use.  In addition, this approach provides a dynamic tool for studying host/pathogen interactions in the setting of acute respiratory disease.

			&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Asthma is a chronic heterogeneous inflammatory disease and is one of the most common lung diseases in the United States affecting 7% of the population. An estimated 5&#45;10% of asthma subjects have severe disease characterized with sub&#45;optimal responses to currently available treatments. This unmet need for better treatments contributes to the major public health burden asthma poses to the nation. Dr. Peters’ work focuses on identifying the molecular pathways that contribute to asthma severity in order to develop novel asthma therapeutics. Dr. Peters’ specific focus has been on understanding how increases in metabolic dysfunction and systemic inflammation could drive asthma severity. The K12 program has enabled Dr. Peters in accomplishing these goals by providing protected research time, structured mentoring, and resources to expand his skills in gene transcriptomics and proteomics technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peters received his undergraduate degree in Economics from Emory University. He completed his MD at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, and his Internal Medicine residency at the University of Colorado, Denver. Most recently he completed his fellowship in Pulmonary and Critical Care medicine at the University of California, San Francisco and he is now an Assistant Professor of Medicine at UCSF. He serves as an attending physician in the intensive care unit at Moffit/Long Hospital and in the severe asthma clinic at UCSF.

			&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Name: Neeta Thakur, MD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			Mentor: Esteban G. Burchard, MD, MPH&lt;br /&gt;
			Scholar Term: 07/2015 – 06/2016
			&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Neeta Thakur is an Assistant Professor and a practicing pulmonary and critical care physician at UCSF&#45;SFGH who examines the role of social adversities on asthma susceptibility and morbidity in vulnerable populations. Dr. Thakur completed a dual degree program in public health and medicine at the University of Arizona focused on community health and program development and evaluation. She came to UCSF for residency in Internal Medicine and stayed to complete a fellowship in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine. Dr. She is currently a member of the Asthma Origins Laboratory, under the mentorship of Dr. Esteban Burchard. The lab focuses on studying the interplay between individuals’ genes and their social and physical environments to determine the root causes of asthma health disparities.


			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Asthma is a common and challenging disease of childhood that disproportionately affects poor minority populations. These populations experience an excess of social adversities, which are important risk factors for asthma morbidity. Asthma is a heterogeneous disease and several asthma phenotypes have been suggested to help categorize at&#45;risk populations. These phenotypes are linked to specific health outcomes such as inhaled corticosteroid response and frequent exacerbations. Applying similar tools employed to identify these phenotypes, Dr. Thakur aims to define the asthma phenotypes that exist in disadvantaged, minority populations and develop a risk profile that identifies individuals at high risk for poor outcomes. This profile will consider the importance of wide&#45;ranging data, including demographic, clinical, social, and environmental data coupled with stress&#45;related biomarkers and genetic data, and will determine which variable are the most useful in predicting who is at risk. This profile will allow providers to better risk stratify individuals and allow for targeting of interventions at those most in need of and, potentially, most receptive to interventions.

			&lt;/p&gt;


			&lt;img style=&quot;width:200px;&quot; class=&quot;imgRight&quot; src=&quot;/sites/pulmonary.ucsf.edu/files/images/christenson.png&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Name: Stephanie Christenson, MD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
			Mentor: Prescott Woodruff, MD, MPH&lt;br&gt;
			Scholar Term: 07/2014 &amp;ndash; 06/2015&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;As the third leading cause of death in the United States with very few therapies that modify long&#45;term outcomes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an important public health concern. Dr. Christenson’s long&#45;term research goal is to leverage genomic applications to identify biomarkers of biology&#45;specific sub&#45;phenotypes (endotypes) of COPD, and use these biomarkers to target therapies to endotypes, and thus personalize COPD therapy to improve clinical response. Dr. Christenson has focused her interest to the area of airway genomics during her internal medicine residency at Boston University.  Under the mentorship of Dr. Avrum Spira, she studied the alterations in global microRNA profiles in the airway with smoking and COPD, and their associations with gene expression.
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Following residency she finished a year&#45;long post&#45;doc in Dr. Spira’s lab, after which, she transitioned to a pulmonary and critical care fellowship at UCSF. Here, Dr. Christenson has continued research in human airway genomics under the mentorship of Dr. Prescott Woodruff. Over the past 3 years she has focused on using gene expression signatures of airway&#45;specific inflammation in large whole transcriptome profiling datasets to identify asthma and COPD subgroups in which particular inflammatory pathways may play bigger roles in disease pathogenesis. She has used these types of analyses to identify a COPD subgroup in which Type 2 inflammation is particularly important. This suggests that we can identify a COPD subgroup that is more similar to asthma on a biological level (as Type 2 inflammation is more common in asthma pathogenesis), and thus may respond better to inhaled corticosteroids and other asthma&#45;specific therapies.
			&lt;/p&gt;

			Co&#45;Mentor: Qizhi Tang, PhD&lt;br&gt;
			Scholar Term: 04/2014 &amp;ndash; 03/2015
			&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Greenland received his undergraduate degree in Chemistry from Stanford.  He did a PhD through the Harvard graduate program in Virology, where he studied the effects of vaccine antigen expression on immune responses.  He received an MD from the Harvard&#45;MIT Division of Health Science and Technology and did residency at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center before completing a Pulmonary and Critical Care Fellowship at UCSF.  He is currently an Assistant Professor of Medicine at UCSF and Staff Physician at the San Francisco VA Medical Center. He serves as an attending physician in the intensive care unit, pulmonary consult service and outpatient pulmonary clinic at the SF VAMC.
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			His research focuses on the immunology of lung transplant rejection and is primarily based in the analysis of human airway and peripheral blood samples. This research uses cellular immunology and genomic techniques to understand acute and chronic lung transplant rejection, with a goal of improving outcomes following lung transplantation. The K12 program has enabled him to progress towards these goals through coursework in biostatistics and genomic data analysis, protected research time, structured mentoring, and connections to research resources in transcriptomics, proteomics, and T&#45;cell receptor genomics.

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;UCSF has a long history of research in asthma and especially in mechanisms of airway inflammation in asthma. Over the past 50 years, multiple faculty members at UCSF have contributed importantly to current knowledge of the specific cells and mediators that drive inflammation in the airways in asthma. Seminal discoveries at UCSF have provided rationale for the treatment of asthma with inhaled anticholinergic drugs and anti&#45;inflammatory drugs such as corticosteroids, leukotriene receptor antagonists, and anti&#45;cytokine therapies (especially anti IL13). UCSF has also been a leader in identifying molecular subtypes of asthma and in developing biomarkers for specific asthma subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Today, asthma research at UCSF is as vibrant as ever with major research initiatives in asthma occurring on the Parnassus campus, the Mission Bay campus, at San Francisco General Hospital, and at the Veteran Affairs Medical Center. Most multicenter asthma research initiatives funded by the NIH include UCSF, which is a participating center for programs such as AsthmaNet, the Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP), the Asthma and Allergy Research Diseases Cooperative Research Centers (AADCRC), and the Inner City Asthma Consortium. Major asthma cohort studies are also based here, including cohort studies in minority populations that are focused on asthma genetics.  UCSF also has two program project grants focused on exploration of mechanisms of airway inflammation and remodeling in asthma.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The UCSF Airway Clinical Research Center (ACRC) at the Parnassus Campus is a major hub of clinical studies and trials for asthma. Investigators in the ACRC aim to uncover disease mechanisms, develop disease biomarkers, and evaluate novel treatments for asthma. The ACRC is a multidisciplinary research unit, which fosters interactions between physician investigators in the Department of Medicine, basic science researchers (especially UCSF’s SABRE program), clinical fellows, and faculty from the Departments of Pediatrics and the School of Nursing. The ACRC represents a unique infrastructure that houses both dedicated clinical research space and sophisticated bench laboratories. Current clinical studies include:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Effect of Vitamin D as an Add&#45;on Therapy to Corticosteroids in Asthma (the VIDA study) – the purpose of the study is to examine the effect of vitamin D in addition to asthma controller medications symptoms of asthma.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Characterization of Asthma Subtypes (the CASA study): Not all asthma is the same, and the CASA study aims to perform careful testing of lung function and careful analyses of mucus and blood specimens to determine how one type of asthma differs from another and it logical treatment can be devised for each subtype.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Role of microRNAs in T Cell&#45;Driven Inflammation in Asthma (the RITA study). MicroRNAs are small molecules that regulate how genes are expressed in cells in the body. T cells are immune cells that are central to mechanisms of inflammation in the airway. The RITA study will explore how specific microRNAs affect the function of T cells in ways that could promote asthma.  &lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Longitudinal study of Severe Asthma: Funded by the Severe Asthma Research Program, this seven&#45;center study aims to improve the understanding of severe asthma in order to develop better treatments.  &lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Mechanisms of Asthma Exacerbations: The major focus of this study is to investigate how abnormal mucus forms in the airways during asthma attacks, and to explores novel agents that could help reduce the viscosity and elasticity of this rubbery mucus.  &lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;

			&lt;h2&gt;Characterization of Adult Subjects for Asthmatic Research Studies (&quot;CASA&quot;)&lt;/h2&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Purpose&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study is to characterize subjects in terms of the nature and severity of asthma and in terms of conditions that may alter the clinical expression of asthma. The study is short but can facilitate enrollment into other asthma clinical research studies at UCSF. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Detailed Description&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;This is a study in patients with asthma and healthy controls in which subjects will be characterized in terms of the nature and severity of asthma and in terms of conditions that may alter the clinical expression of asthma. Characterization involves obtaining a medical history and breathing tests, sputum analysis, and blood tests.  Using these tests we can evaluate how different types of asthma are related to different kinds of inflammation and we can determine if volunteers may have additional research studies available to them for their participation.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Please call 1&#45;866&#45;2&#45;INHALE for more information on the CASA study.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h2&gt;Study of the Effect of Vitamin D as an Add&#45;on Therapy to Corticosteroids in Asthma (&quot;VIDA&quot;)&lt;/h2&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Purpose&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the study is to find out if taking vitamin D in addition to an asthma controller medication helps to prevent worsening of asthma symptoms and asthma attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Detailed Description&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;This is a randomized, double&#45;blind parallel group trial that will enroll individuals who have vitamin D insufficiency and asthma with persistent symptoms despite low&#45;dose inhaled corticosteroid. Participants on low&#45;dose inhaled corticosteroid will be randomized to add&#45;on therapy with either placebo or high&#45;dose vitamin D for a 28&#45;week period. During the inhaled corticosteroid&#45;stable phase, participants will remain on low&#45;dose inhaled corticosteroid. During the inhaled corticosteroid&#45;taper phase, participants will taper their inhaled corticosteroid by 50% at two time&#45;points post&#45;randomization. The investigators will determine if the addition of vitamin D reduces the likelihood of treatment failure when compared to placebo during both the inhaled corticosteroid&#45;stable and inhaled corticosteroid&#45;taper phases of the study. Given the high prevalence of both vitamin D insufficiency and asthma, this trial has high potential to impact daily asthma management.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Please call 1&#45;866&#45;2&#45;INHALE for more information on the VIDA study.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h2&gt;Role of microRNAs in T Cell&#45;Driven Inflammation in Asthma (&quot;RITA&quot;)&lt;/h2&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Purpose&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of microRNAs in Th2&#45;driven inflammation in asthma.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Detailed Description&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;This is a single center study of asthmatic subjects and healthy controls which will investigate mechanisms of asthma through detailed molecular analysis of airway tissues and fluids. The investigators hypothesize that asthma is associated with abnormal expression of miRNAs in T cells which favors differentiation into Th2&#45;cells. The investigators further hypothesize that asthma is heterogeneous based on the presence and absence of Th2&#45;driven inflammation and that abnormalities in T cell miRNA expression will be most prominent in a subgroup with high levels of Th2&#45;driven inflammation (as assessed using molecular markers that the investigators have previously established). Finally, the investigators hypothesize that inhaled corticosteroids will normalize the T&#45;cell miRNA abnormalities observed in asthma, as corticosteroids treat Th2&#45;driven inflammation. The samples collected will also facilitate the pursuit of secondary analyses designed to investigate mechanisms of inflammation and remodeling in asthma as well as molecular phenotypes of asthma.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Please call 1&#45;866&#45;2&#45;INHALE  for more information on the RITA study.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h2&gt;Mucus Study (&quot;MUCGAL&quot;)&lt;/h2&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Purpose&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study is to investigate how abnormal mucus forms in diseases of the airways such as asthma and cystic fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;Detailed Description&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The study protocol involves collection of samples of induced sputum from healthy controls and patients with asthma and cystic fibrosis. Induced sputum is sputum that is coughed up when a solution of salty water is inhaled. The study protocol involves multiple visits for collection of the induced sputum &#45; usually the visit number is between 2 and 5 but it can be as high as 10. By examining the biochemical and biophysical properties of the sputum samples from different patient groups and also the effects of drugs and chemicals on the sputum after it is collected, we can infer mechanism of disease that may be helpful in developing drugs to treat abnormal mucus.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Please call 1&#45;866&#45;2&#45;INHALE for more information on the MUCGAL study. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Patients with lung disease were offered in&#45;depth personalized health services at a half&#45;day fair, thanks to a unique collaboration between UCSF pulmonologists and the Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Pulmonologists Prescott Woodruff, MD, MPH of UCSF, and Neeta Thakur, MD, of UCSF and ZSFG, met with patients at the Southeast Health Center in Bayview Hunter’s Point.  The 40 patients, who had asthma and/or COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), were able to meet with lung disease specialists from UCSF and ZSFG, review inhaler use and technique with pharmacists from SEHC and Walgreens, and have targeted health assessment completed by asthma and COPD trained nurses and staff. In addition, the event incorporated activities that promote health, well&#45;being, and awareness of the unique problems that patients with lung disease who live in the Bayview/Hunter’s Point neighborhood face. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Food and drink, gift bags and raffle prizes were provided courtesy of the Nina Ireland Program for Lung Health, Whole Foods and local farmers.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Prescott G. Woodruff is a Professor of Medicine at UCSF and a member of the American Society for Clinical Investigation. He specializes in pulmonary and critical care medicine. He also conducts research at UCSF's Airway Clinical Research Center and General Clinical Research Center where he studies the mechanisms of inflammation, airway remodeling and airway hyper&#45;responsiveness in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Neeta Thakur is an Assistant Professor and pulmonary and critical care physician at UCSF and ZSFG, who examines the role of social and environmental stressors on asthma susceptibility and morbidity in vulnerable populations. She is currently a member of the Asthma Collaboratory, under the mentorship of Dr. Esteban Burchard.

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;
			Developmental biology is the study of how an organism grows from a fertilized egg into the adult form. In humans, development of the lungs begins around the third week of gestation and their maturation continues into adolescence. Researchers in the division utilize animal models and samples isolated from human donors to study questions such as:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;How is the complex 3&#45;dimensional structure of the lung achieved during fetal development?&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;How are the many cell types of the lung generated from embryonic progenitor cell populations?&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;How do genetic and environmental pressures influence these processes and contribute to lung disease?&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Do complications early in life predispose individuals to lung disease later in life?&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Can knowledge about lung development be exploited for the purposes of regenerative medicine?&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;
			Research in lung cancer and mesothelioma focuses on understanding the chemoresistance of these resistant thoracic solid tumors.  The work concentrates on studies of 3D spheroids, either generated from tumor cell lines or from actual tumor grown ex vivo.  With 3D spheroids, tumor cells exhibit additional chemoresistance that mimicks that of solid tumors.  The resistance to apoptosis is mediated by altered expression of the Bcl&#45;2 family of anti&#45; and pro&#45;apoptotic proteins within spheroids.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Role of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) in undermining multicellular resistance of mesothelioma spheroids by altering Bim and Noxa expression.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;
			Use of small molecule molecules to displace Bim from Bcl&#45;2 storage sites and thereby enhance apoptotic response of 3D spheroids to therapeutic agents.
			&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Analysis of changes in genetic expression in cells in 2D compared to 3D for identifying key 3D genetic targets coupled with the use of connectivity analysis to select non&#45;patented drugs that will suppress gene expression of 3D spheroids and thereby reduce resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Testing for pro&#45;apoptotic synergy in human tumor ex vivo spheroids grown from resected viable mesothelioma and lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Use of lung cancer pleural effusions to culture lung cancer 3D spheroids for drug screening.   &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;UCSF has been a prominent site for research on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases (COPD), including Chronic Bronchitis and Emphysema, for more than 40 years.  Our faculty are involved in studies of the basic pathogenetic mechanisms of COPD, genetics, epidemiology, early diagnosis, and treatment, as well as studies on the role of smoking, air pollution, and exposure to fumes from biomass fuels.  UCSF was one of ten sites selected by the NHLBI to participate in the COPD Clinical Research Network, and one of six in the SPIROMICS network.  Current COPD research at UCSF includes:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Demonstration of early physiologic, anatomic, and inflammatory changes in humans with COPD.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Effects of second&#45;hand smoke in the development of COPD.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Use of cardio&#45;pulmonary exercise testing to identify early physiologic involvement.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Effects of air pollution and wood smoke on development of COPD.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Gene expression and miRNA profiling in blood cells and plasma to develop diagnostic tests for COPD.&lt;/li&gt;

				&lt;li&gt;Airway epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in the lung in the context of injury, including emphysema.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Role of the airway epithelium in modulating innate immune responses that lead to chronic airway inflammation and mucus hypersecretion.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Role of integrins in the development of emphysema.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Mast cell&#45;derived peptidases and the pathogenesis of COPD.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Identification of molecular phenotypes of COPD.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Development of intermediate outcome measures that can be used in clinical trials of COPD&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Clinical studies of novel therapeutic approaches to COPD, including macrolide antibiotics and statins.&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Subpopulations and intermediate outcome measures in COPD study (SPIROMICS) is an observational (no drug) study that supports the prospective collection and analysis of phenotypic, biomarker, genetic, genomic, and clinical data from subjects with COPD for the purpose of identifying subpopulations and intermediate outcome measures. It is funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and is coordinated by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;Detailed Description&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Research subjects for SPIROMICS will be enrolled, phenotyped, and followed at six SPIROMICS Clinical Centers (in Winston&#45;Salem, NC; Ann Arbor, MI; San Francisco, CA; Los Angeles, CA; New York City, NY; and Salt Lake City, UT). Molecular fingerprinting and extensive subject phenotyping will be performed to identify disease subpopulations and to identify and validate surrogate markers of disease severity, which will be useful as intermediate outcome measures for future clinical trials. Secondary aims are to clarify the natural history of COPD, to develop bioinformatic resources that will enable the utilization and sharing of data in studies of COPD and related diseases, and to create a collection of clinical, biomarker, radiographic, and genetic data that can be used by external investigators for other studies of COPD.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Please call 415&#45;269&#45;6370 for more information on the SPIROMICS study.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h2&gt;Characterization of Innate Immunity in COPD&lt;/h2&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Purpose&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The goal of this study is to better understand how chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects the immune system's ability to fight infection in the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Detailed Description&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;COPD exacerbations (&amp;quot;flare&#45;ups&amp;quot;) are associated with accelerated disease progression and result in increased emergency&#45;room visits and hospitalization. About half of COPD exacerbations are thought to be due to underlying microbial infections. In addition, patients with COPD exacerbation have increased susceptibility to secondary respiratory infections. Immune cells that line the airways are the first line of defense against microbial pathogens in the lungs. Over 90% of these immune cells are alveolar macrophages, specialized cells that are able to phagocytize (&amp;quot;devour&amp;quot;) and kill microbial pathogens. Recent evidence suggests the phagocytic ability of alveolar macrophages in patients with COPD may be defective. To investigate this phenomenon, alveolar macrophages from healthy and COPD subjects are examined for their phagocytic ability and cytokine production profile.  Macrophages are then screened against a protein library to identify potential therapeutic targets that could rescue this defect.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;The Respiratory Epidemiology Group is an interdisciplinary group of investigators who study the epidemiology and health outcomes of pulmonary conditions.
			&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Our Mission:&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;To apply state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art epidemiologic and biostatistical methods to study health outcomes, in particular disability, mortality, and impaired health&#45;related quality of life, in a broad array of pulmonary conditions as well as in lung transplantation.
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To identify risk factors, in particular environmental and occupational factors, for adverse and beneficial health outcomes.
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To help refine candidate selection for lung transplantation.
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To translate science into policy aimed at reducing the burden of respiratory disease and improving quality of life.
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Our vision:&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;To reduce the burden of chronic respiratory disease.
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To decrease suffering, lost years of good quality of life, and death from pulmonary disease.
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To improve survival, functioning, and quality of life after lung transplantation.
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Our areas of research include:&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Development of worsened impairment, disability, and deficits in quality of life in various respiratory conditions and prior to and following lung transplantation.
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The impact of pre&#45;operative body composition (e.g., sarcopenia, adiposity, frailty) on disability, quality of life, and survival following lung transplantation.
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Health outcomes in over a range of respiratory disease severity, including asthma and COPD. &lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Impact of environmental exposures, including secondhand smoke exposure and air pollution, on patients with respiratory conditions
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The role of antifungal agents in skin cancer in lung transplantation
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Health care costs of lung disease, including the indirect costs of work loss.
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interaction between occupation and lung disease
			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Effect of occupational exposures on health outcomes
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Impact of obstructive lung diseases on work disability
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Biomarkers linked to adverse respiratory disease outcomes

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Patients with lung disease were offered in&#45;depth personalized health services at a half&#45;day fair, thanks to a unique collaboration between UCSF pulmonologists and the Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Pulmonologists Prescott Woodruff, MD, MPH of UCSF, and Neeta Thakur, MD, of UCSF and ZSFG, met with patients at the Southeast Health Center in Bayview Hunter’s Point. The 40 patients, who had asthma and/or COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), were able to meet with lung disease specialists from UCSF and ZSFG, review inhaler use and technique with pharmacists from SEHC and Walgreens, and have targeted health assessment completed by asthma and COPD trained nurses and staff. In addition, the event incorporated activities that promote health, well&#45;being, and awareness of the unique problems that patients with lung disease who live in the Bayview/Hunter’s Point neighborhood face.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Food and drink, gift bags and raffle prizes were provided courtesy of the Nina Ireland Program for Lung Health, Whole Foods and local farmers.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Prescott G. Woodruff is a Professor of Medicine at UCSF and a member of the American Society for Clinical Investigation. He specializes in pulmonary and critical care medicine. He also conducts research at UCSF's Airway Clinical Research Center and General Clinical Research Center where he studies the mechanisms of inflammation, airway remodeling and airway hyper&#45;responsiveness in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Neeta Thakur is an Assistant Professor and pulmonary and critical care physician at UCSF and ZSFG, who examines the role of social and environmental stressors on asthma susceptibility and morbidity in vulnerable populations. She is currently a member of the Asthma Collaboratory, under the mentorship of Dr. Esteban Burchard.

		<FileBody>

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;UCSF has been a major center for cystic fibrosis research for more than 25 years, receiving funding from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, National Institutes of Health, and other agencies.  For example, the Cystic Fibrosis Research and Development program at UCSF, one of the few basic research centers sponsored by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, has long focused on understanding the biology of alterations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein and identifying molecular approaches to correct fundamental defects in CFTR that lead to disease. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;In addition, UCSF physicians and researchers are engaged in many other areas of cystic fibrosis research.  For adults with CF cared for at our Center, clinical research studies led by UCSF investigators provide opportunities for patients to participate as research study volunteers.  Some areas of recent and ongoing research investigation are highlighted below.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Clinical trials of new therapies for CF&lt;/b&gt;:  The UCSF Adult CF Center, led by Mary Ellen Kleinhenz, MD and Yvonne Huang, MD, has been involved in pharmaceutical trials of new treatments for CF lung disease.  These have included studies of inhaled ciprofloxacin and inhaled levofloxacin antibiotic regimens to manage lung disease in patients chronically colonized with the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa. &lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Microbiome studies in CF&lt;/b&gt;:  Although the lungs of CF patients typically are infected by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the entire microbial community present in the lungs is now known to be considerably more complex. Moreover, depending on the microbial milieu, organisms not traditionally thought to have pathogenic consequence may be detrimental and contribute to inflammation.  Understanding components of this microbiome that contribute to lung inflammation and disease progression, as well as how the microbiome is affected by therapies, are all active areas of research interest.  In addition, many CF patients suffer concurrently from upper respiratory problems like chronic sinusitis, and studies are ongoing to improve our understanding of the CF sinus microbiome.  &lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Airway mucus biology in CF&lt;/b&gt;: Abnormal mucus is a hallmark of CF lung disease as well as other airway diseases.  Understanding the basis of abnormal mucus properties and hypersecretion in CF, as well as development of new approaches to reduce abnormal mucus in the airways, are active areas of investigation in the division.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quality and transition to adult CF&lt;/b&gt;:  Spearheaded by a Cystic Fibrosis Foundation grant for quality improvement in CF care, we have ongoing initiatives to facilitate patient transition from pediatric to adult CF care, a challenge faced by all individuals with CF and their care providers.  Through CFF support, we have established a program of communication including pre&#45;transition meetings with pediatric patients and printed resources, to make the transition to adult CF care as seamless as possible.  &lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;
			The Asthma Origins Lab, under Dr. Esteban González Burchard, has assembled the largest genetic combined study of pediatric asthma in the world.
			&lt;p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Over the past 12 years we have recruited over 9,000 Latino and African American children from throughout the mainland U.S., Puerto Rico, and Mexico. As part of our research to understand the importance of genetic and environmental factors, we have collected a broad spectrum of information on our study participants. Most individuals have genome&#45;wide genotype data. Approximately 600 individuals also have genome&#45;wide methyl typing. In addition, we have isolated RNA and serum on the individuals recruited in our largest studies, GALA II and SAGE II. We have also collected detailed phenotype information including spirometry, bronchodilator response, biomarkers such as nicotine metabolites and total IgE, skin prick tests for common allergens, detailed information on socioeconomic status (SES) and geocoded air pollution on most study participants (N ~ 6,000). More detail can be found at our &lt;a href=&quot;https://pharm.ucsf.edu/burchard&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;lab website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;We collaborate with a diverse group of clinicians, bioinformaticians, epidemiologists, and basic scientists on a broad range of questions from pulmonology, to health disparities, to population genetics. In addition, we are affiliated with the NHLBI&#45;funded EVE Asthma Genetics Consortium, a large multiethnic consortium seeking to characterize genetic risk factors across multiple populations.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Genetic Epidemoiology of Asthma &amp;amp; Drug Response&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;We have assembled the largest pediatric asthma genetic study of minority children in the U.S. We have recruited and phenotyped over 9,000 Latino and African American children from throughout the U.S. We have detailed phenotype information including spirometry, bronchodilator response, total IgE, skin prick testing, genome&#45;wide data, detailed information on socioeconomic status (SES) and geocoded air pollution on most study participants. More detail can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;https://pharm.ucsf.edu/burchard/research/study&#45;populations&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. We are aalso part of the National Asthma Genetics Consortium (EVE), and the Consortium on Asthma among African&#45;ancestry Populations in the Americas (CAAPA).&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;
			Health Services Research at UCSF. The first multidisciplinary health services research unit in the US was formed at UCSF when Philip R. Lee, then the Chancellor of UCSF, founded what would become the Philip R. Lee Institute for Health Policy Studies in 1972.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Today, the PRL&#45;IHPS faculty combines a diverse group of social scientists (economists, sociologists, anthropologists, ethnographers, statisticians, etc.) with epidemiologists and clinicians from many fields.  Pulmonologists have a long tradition with PRL&#45;IHPS, with John Luce becoming the first pulmonary&#45;health services fellow in the 1990s.  One of our faculty, &lt;a href=&quot;/about/faculty.html?key=746d76873d9b4c16b6ca18e57fa52712&amp;name=DUDLEY%2CRAYMOND+A&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;R. Adams Dudley, MD, MBA&lt;/a&gt;, is currently Associate Director of PRL&#45;IHPS and in charge of the research portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;PRL&#45;IHPS faculty work in and often across three primary areas: Healthcare Systems, Population Health and Determinants, and Clinical Practice:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Healthcare System&lt;/b&gt; faculty examine outcomes, quality, and measurement of healthcare delivery systems with research and practice that spans from the individual clinic to hospital and healthcare systems. They also play a leadership role in translating research findings into policy, program, and healthcare delivery practices. PRL&#45;IHPS faculty have informed the development of value&#45;based purchasing approaches and have undertaken cost and cost&#45;effectiveness studies across a wide domain of conditions and systems both domestically and internationally. Healthcare system faculty also conducts research on the healthcare workforce with a particular focus on nursing and primary care providers. The Institute is particularly interested in ensuring that our healthcare system delivers appropriate care to at&#45;risk populations including children and the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Population Health and Determinants&lt;/b&gt; faculty focus on disparities in health and healthcare. Faculty examine how to ensure access to primary care for low&#45;income populations in California and nationwide. For example, Institute faculty and staff work on shaping state and national policies related to reproductive health access. PRL&#45;IHPS faculty use longitudinal data to examine chronic disease and its impact on vulnerable patients. Vulnerable populations are also a key focus of longstanding PRL&#45;IHPS research and translational efforts related to substance use policy and tobacco control. Institute faculty have examined the impact of the environment on reproductive health outcomes and child health. Additionally, faculty study disasters – both natural and human&#45;created – with a particular focus on health and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;In &lt;b&gt;Clinical Practice&lt;/b&gt;, PRL&#45;IHPS has long been a leader in research and policy translation related to technology evaluation, drugs, and pharmaceuticals. The Institute boasts a path&#45;breaking program on the production of research and medical evidence that touches on issues related to industry sponsorship, conflict of interest, and research integrity. In award&#45;winning work, Institute faculty have developed and put into practice decision&#45;making tools that facilitate the delivery of patient&#45;centered care. PRL&#45;IHPS is also at the forefront of understanding how genetic technologies and personalized medicine will shape and re&#45;shape clinical practice of the future.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;In all these areas, PRL&#45;IHPS recognizes that policy problems are complex and are most effectively addressed by using the perspectives and tools of multiple disciplines and fields. However, different disciplines and fields use different “languages,” conceptual frameworks, methods, and standards of evidence. It is often difficult to bring lessons from one field into another and even more challenging to synthesize and translate research findings so that they can help inform decisions of policymakers, program managers, clinicians, and others concerned with health policy issues.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Over a period of 40 years, PRL&#45;IHPS has demonstrated success in overcoming these disciplinary barriers to promote rigorous research translation into policy and practice. PRL&#45;IHPS’ vibrant community of scholars from many disciplines, work effectively together to address critical health and health policy issues. Our unique contribution is our ability to apply a multi&#45;disciplinary perspective in collaboration with others within and outside the Institute and UCSF. From its founding, PRL&#45;IHPS has been a community where research from many disciplines is conducted, synthesized, and translated so that it can be applied to real&#45;world policy arenas, program areas, and practice settings.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;Faculty&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;The Human Exposure Laboratory (HEL) is one of a small number of facilities in the U.S. that are equipped to conduct controlled human exposure studies of inhaled pollutants.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The HEL, built in 1985 and renovated in 2008, is equipped with a 9'x9'x9' environmental chamber with automated climate control; generation and monitoring equipment for many pollutants including ozone, chlorine, secondhand tobacco smoke, and wood smoke exposure; exercise treadmill and cycle ergometer; equipment for cardiorespiratory physiologic testing; and an adjacent wet lab for experimentation on biologic samples (blood, sputum, nasal and bronchoalveolar lavage samples) using a variety of basic molecular and cell biology approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The HEL has been studying the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to air pollutants of human subjects for over 25 years supported by funding from the NIH, the Health Effects Institute, the California Air Resources Board, the Flight Attendant Medical Research Institute, the American Lung Association, and the Chest Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h2&gt;The Vision&lt;/h2&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Both the upper and lower respiratory tracts are constantly exposed to various environmental pollutants, allergens, and toxins, which interact with airways and alveoli and result in inflammation, injury, and disease.  Exposure&#45;related respiratory and cardiovascular diseases are increasingly recognized as a growing global problem.  The mission of HEL is to study the health effects of air pollutants with emphasis on oxidative stress and inflammation as mechanisms by which inhaled pollutants contribute to cardiopulmonary pathophysiology in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;
			Pulmonary Immunology Research has deep roots at UCSF, replete with past successes and with ongoing broad strengths in basic, translational and clinical investigation involving numerous members of the faculty of the Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine Divisions at UCSF’s major campuses. The investigators in these Divisions benefit from deep ties with immunology&#45;focused investigators in other clinical and basic science Divisions and Departments, including Infectious Diseases, Rheumatology, Surgery, Anatomy, Pathology, Microbiology/Immunology, and Biochemistry/Biophysics. Several of the Division’s investigators connect to Immunology PhD Programs as part of UCSF’s Biomedical Sciences (BMS) graduate program. The historically large bequest leading to founding of the Nina Ireland Lung Disease Program (NILDP) facilitated recent expansion of immunological research activities in theme areas of Lung Transplantation, Interstitial Lung Disease, and Global Health.  Active research activities in Pulmonary Immunology include:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Basic investigations of the role of immune cells in apoptotic cell and collagen clearance in mouse models of health and disease.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Basic, translational and clinical investigations of the autoimmune basis of fibrotic interstitial lung diseases.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Basic studies of the roles of immune cell cysteine cathepsins and serine proteases in antigen presentation, lymphocyte selection, lymphangiogenesis and host defense against airway pathogenic bacteria.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Basic, translational and clinical/pharmaceutical studies of the roles of integrins adhesion molecules in host defense, immune cell function, and allergen sensitization.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Mouse and human genetic studies of the immunopathogenesis of asthma.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Basic and translational studies of the roles of platelet and neutrophil aggregation in transfusion&#45;associated immune lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Translational studies of predictors, biomarkers, and immune mechanisms of primary graft dysfunction and bronchiolitis obliterans in human lung allograft recipients.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Basic and human genetic studies of roles of mast cells, mast cell proteases and genetic variation in host defense against pathogens and allergic airway disease.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Studies of contributions of microRNA expression to immunophenotypes in allergic airway inflammation and other lung diseases in humans and in mouse models of disease.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Studies of the airway microbiome, including known and novel pathogens involved in exacerbations and persistence of obstructive lung diseases and lung allograft rejection&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;UCSF has a distinguished history of groundbreaking research in HIV&#45;associated pulmonary diseases. Since the earliest days of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, many of the leading studies on the epidemiology, presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and critical care of Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and other HIV&#45;associated opportunistic pneumonias were conducted at San Francisco General Hospital and UCSF.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/pulmonary.ucsf.edu/files/images/checkup_aids.jpg&quot; class=&quot;imgRight&quot;/&gt;
			&lt;p&gt; At the US peak of the epidemic, San Francisco General Hospital/UCSF was one of 6 clinical sites participating in the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute’s (NHLBI) Pulmonary Complications of HIV Infection Study, the first multicenter prospective cohort study of pulmonary diseases in persons with HIV. This tradition continues today where San Francisco General Hospital/UCSF is one of 8 clinical sites for the NHLBI’s Lung HIV Study, a multi&#45;R01 consortium designed to examine a diverse range of infectious and non&#45;infectious pulmonary diseases in HIV&#45;infected persons in the US and in sub&#45;Saharan Africa. San Francisco General Hospital/
			UCSF is also one of 6 clinical and sequencing sites for the NHLBI’s Lung HIV Microbiome Project, a multi&#45;U01 consortium established to study the lung microbiome in HIV infection. UCSF researchers have risen to the global challenge of HIV/AIDS, and the division has vibrant research collaborations with pulmonary colleagues at Mulago Hospital and Makerere University School of Medicine in Kampala, Uganda. UCSF researchers are involved in a wide range of clinical and translational research studies in HIV&#45;associated pulmonary diseases based at San Francisco General Hospital and Mulago Hospital (see separate description of ongoing tuberculosis&#45;related research). These studies include:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/pulmonary.ucsf.edu/files/images/group_infection.jpg&quot; class=&quot;imgRight&quot;/&gt;
			&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;A prospective, multicenter cohort study of HIV&#45;infected patients hospitalized with acute pneumonia to determine the etiology and mortality of HIV&#45;associated opportunistic pneumonias in areas with and without universal access to combination antiretroviral therapy (ART)&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Studies examining the diagnosis of PCP, bacterial pneumonia (and TB) and the use of biomarkers as prognostic tools for these opportunistic pneumonias&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Studies of putative trimethoprim&#45;sulfamethoxazole drug resistance in Pneumocystis and its potential mechanisms&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Immunologic studies of Pneumocystis in HIV&#45;infected persons and in healthcare workers caring for persons with HIV&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Epidemiology and transmission studies of human Pneumocystis addressing the question of whether human Pneumocystis is transmitted from person&#45;to&#45;person via an airborne route (as has been shown convincingly in laboratory animals) and whether disease results from reactivation of latent infection and/or from recent exposure and infection&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Studies of air pollution on host immunity and risk of opportunistic pneumonias and COPD exacerbations in HIV&#45;infected persons&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Studies examining the microbial communities in the lungs, oropharynx, and gastrointestinal tract of HIV&#45;infected persons at all stages of HIV/AIDS from acute (primary) HIV infection to chronic HIV infection to acute opportunistic infection (pneumonia)&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;These studies involve collaborations between clinical and laboratory&#45;based researchers at San Francisco General Hospital and UCSF, as well as those throughout the US and the world.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;
			ALI Research at UCSF.  UCSF has a rich history of research on ALI that includes studies on the role of surfactant in the injured lung, research on the resolution of excess fluid (pulmonary edema) in the lung, and many studies in partnership with the National Institutes of Health’s ARDS Network, for which UCSF was one of the founding institutions.  This research has led to therapies such as surfactant replacement in neonatal ALI and gentler lung ventilation that have undoubtedly saved thousands of lives.  At UCSF, our group of Pulmonary and Critical Care specialists has active research programs that are taking novel approaches to the prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment of ALI.  These programs include:
			&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Laboratory&#45;based molecular, cell, and animal models of acute lung injury in mice, rats, and large animals (including sheep), with a focus on understanding the pathogenesis and resolution of pulmonary edema in acute lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Biologic and therapeutic effects of allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) using animal models and a novel ex vivo perfused human lung preparation.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Basic and translational research on how platelets can contribute to ALI and the use of platelet inhibitors as treatment for ALI.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Basic research on ischemia&#45;reperfusion lung injury/primary graft dysfunction using a mouse model of orthotopic lung transplantation.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;State&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art imaging of ALI in real&#45;time in live, experimental animal models.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Clinical research focusing on biologic and clinical predictors for developing acute lung injury, as well as the pathogenesis and resolution of lung injury.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;NHLBI site since 1995 for running phase III clinical trials of treatments for patients with acute lung injury (ARDS Network).&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Clinical and translational research on how cigarette smoke exposure (active and passive) may increase the risk of developing ALI and other critical illness outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Clinical research on how genetic markers can be used to predict who develops ALI and how these markers can predict the clinical outcome of ALI.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Clinical research on how to identify and treat ALI patients early in their hospitalization.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;
			The research environment is intended to foster productive interactions between basic and clinical scientists.  Members of the research group include fellows and faculty from the Departments of Medicine, Anesthesia, Pediatrics, and the CVRI. Several young faculty members contribute substantially to an environment to foster the growth of the next generation of pulmonary and critical care medicine investigators, as well as high quality research.

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;
			Regenerative Medicine research at UCSF at this point in time is a vigorous pre&#45;clinical program with the near&#45;term goal of delineating the major pathways of lung repair following major injury.   Findings from UCSF investigators, as well as other researchers, indicate that endogenous lung stem and/or progenitor cells expand and attempt to restore normal lung function after an acute insult.  How these processes are regulated, exactly what cells are involved, and how human and rodent model systems compare in their responses to injury are all important questions under active investigation.   A longer term goal is to use the detailed cell and molecular signaling roadmaps of stem/progenitor cell&#45;mediated repair to promote regeneration in diseases as diverse as adult respiratory distress syndrome, emphysema, fibrotic lung disease, and cystic fibrosis.    A parallel goal is to test the efficacy of cell&#45;based therapies either directly in the treatment of these disorders or as sources of healthy cells incorporated into bio&#45;engineered lung tissue.   The overall objective is to exploit the regenerative potential of the lung to benefit patients with chronic, intractable lung disease.   &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;List of faculty and projects directed at the study of lung regeneration at UCSF include:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;
			Sarcoidosis Research at UCSF. Founded in the fall of 2009, the Sarcoidosis Research Program spans all aspects of research: clinical, translational and basic. Studies performed by members of this Program have identified the power of blood genomics in identifying markers of disease severity and overlap in expression of inflammatory pathway&#45;related genes between the blood and lung. The Sarcoidosis Research Program consists of a cohort of patients with sarcoidosis and unaffected control subjects whom we are indebted to for their participation. Below is a summary of the types of questions we are working to address: &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;How does the type and severity of respiratory symptoms relate to immune cells and markers in the blood? Can we identify new &quot;targets&quot; for therapy that could lessen the side effects of current treatment approaches?&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Are there differences in the types of inflammatory markers in the blood of sarcoidosis subjects with lung disease compared to those without lung disease?&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;What can this tell us about the underlying biology of the disease or its progression?&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Can we develop a blood&#45;based test to diagnose sarcoidosis?&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;How common are neurologic symptoms in subjects with sarcoidosis and how do they relate to specific blood markers and other physical symptoms?&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Can we use a non&#45;invasive imaging test of the retina (called &quot;Optical Coherence Tomography&quot;) to determine which subjects have neurological involvement in sarcoidosis? Also, can we use other non&#45;invasive tests, such as electrophysiology of visual pathways and MRI of the brain to detect neurologic sarcoidosis and distinguish sarcoidosis from other neurological problems?&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Are there blood markers that can help to identify patients with neurologic sarcoidosis and measure disease activity? &lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;How does fatigue and its severity relate to markers in the blood? Can we use this information to guide treatment for fatigue?&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;In addition to these studies, UCSF was selected as one of the research sites for the multi&#45;center, NIH&#45;funded study called GENOMIC RESEARCH IN ALPHA&#45;1 ANTITRYPSIN DEFICIENCY AND SARCOIDOSIS (GRADS). The goals of this study are to:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Identify whether sarcoidosis is caused by specific micro&#45;organisms or whether these organisms cause progressive disease or specific types of pulmonary disease/&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Measure gene expression of blood inflammatory cells and relate these markers to specific manifestations of pulmonary and extrapulmonary sarcoidosis.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;This study is anticipated to begin enrollment in the spring of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;
			Sepsis research at UCSF. UCSF has a long and rich history of studying patients with sepsis to understand its contribution to the development of acute respiratory failure, specifically acute lung injury, and multiple organ failure. There have been several studies completed at UCSF supported by NIH R01 grants to study the role of biologic markers for understanding pathogenesis and prognosis in sepsis. Furthermore the patients with the highest mortality in the NHLBI ARDS Network have been those with sepsis. UCSF is a site for the ARDS Network Phase III Clinical Trials since 1995. At UCSF, our group of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine specialists have active research programs that have novel approaches to early diagnosis, pathogenesis, and treatment of sepsis. These programs include: &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Laboratory&#45;based molecular, cell, and animal studies of sepsis in mice, rats, and large animals (including sheep) with a focus on better insights into the pathogenesis and potential treatment pathways for severe sepsis.

				&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Allogeneic human bone marrow&#45;derived mesenchymal stem cells are being tested in animal models of sepsis, including a novel ex vivo perfused human lung preparation.
				&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Another focus is the potential role of platelets and the therapeutic value of platelet inhibitors on lung infection that often leads to sepsis. &lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;There is a new exciting program researching the influence of passive and active cigarette smoke exposure on the development of multiple organ failure following sepsis from a pulmonary or non&#45;pulmonary cause. &lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;There is also a program studying candidate genes that may predispose specific groups of patients, including African&#45;Americans, to the development of sepsis and organ failure from serious infections.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;There is a particular interest in the role of the noradrenergic sympathetic system in regulating host response to localized and systemic infection. &lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;New studies have also been initiated to evaluate the potential importance of epigenetic changes or alterations in patients with sepsis that may predispose them to the development of multiple organ failure.

				&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;There is ongoing participation in a phase III NHLBI ARDS Network clinical trial to test the role of statins in reducing the sequelae of acute lung injury from infectious causes.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;There is a major clinical research program to study patients early in their clinical course, specifically in the Emergency Department, prior to admission to the ICU, in order to identify clinical and biologic markers that provide insight into the pathogenesis and prognosis of patients with sepsis. 	  &lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The research environment encompasses both basic laboratory and clinical research and includes important collaboration with fellows and faculty from the departments of Anesthesia, Pediatrics, Surgery, Medicine and the Cardiovascular Research Institute. There are fellows, Assistant Professors, Associate Professors, and Professors involved in all of this basic and clinical research.&lt;/p&gt;

			Sleep research at UCSF is closely integrated with the UCSF Sleep Disorders Center, an active clinical program with an 8&#45;bed sleep laboratory for overnight polysomnography.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;This has allowed for multi&#45;center collaborations investigating such topics as risk factors for sleep&#45;disordered breathing, limb movement disorders, implantable nerve stimulation, and sleep&#45;related disablement.  Additionally, sleep researchers have formed collaborations with the Kaiser Division of Research and UCSF’s Institute for Health Policy Studies to establish longitudinal patient cohorts for the investigation of sleep&#45;disordered breathing, insomnia, and other sleep disturbances.  These collaborations have in particular focused on sleep disorders in the context of other chronic comorbidities, especially obstructive lung diseases and rheumatologic diseases.  Additionally, the San Francisco Veterans’ Affairs Medical Center and San Francisco General Hospital have active clinical programs in sleep medicine, with the VA medical center having opened a 2&#45;bed sleep laboratory in 2011.  This is allowing for the development of collaborative research programs in sleep medicine across the UCSF&#45;affiliated institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Over the last three decades, lung transplantation has grown exponentially. Today, it aims to improve survival and health&#45;related quality of life for patients suffering from advanced non&#45;malignant lung diseases. Driven by these two overarching aims, our group of investigators at UCSF are focused on advancing the practice of lung transplantation and understanding the mechanisms driving key clinical outcomes including chronic allograft rejection and malignancies after transplant. &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Our lung transplant research group includes investigators from multiple Departments, reflecting the multi&#45;disciplinary nature of the field. The unique patient population undergoing transplant at UCSF also provides opportunities to study rarer lung conditions such as scleroderma and other auto&#45;immune related interstitial lung disease. Researchers from Departments of Medicine, Surgery, Dermatology, Lab Medicine, Anesthesia and Health Policy are applying state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art methodologies across the spectrum of clinical, translational, and basic science to ongoing studies including:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Clinical&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;The identification of clinical risk factors for poorer outcomes after transplant, including allograft rejection and death.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;The impact of lung transplantation on patient&#45;centered outcomes including health&#45;related quality of life.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Risk prediction modeling for the development of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma after lung transplantation including the potential causative role of voriconazole.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;The role of pre&#45;operative frailty and sarcopenia on clinical complications, quality of life, and survival after transplant.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;The impact of community&#45;acquired respiratory viruses on allograft function.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Translational&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Improving lung function and viability through the application of mesenchymal stem cells to human donor lungs prior to transplantation in an ex&#45;vivo lung perfusion system.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Expanding viral pathogen detection through ViroChip, PCR, and deep sequencing methods and the investigating impact of these detected viruses on chronic allograft rejection. &lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Diagnostics for the detection and prediction of acute and chronic rejection. &lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Diagnostics for the detection of donor specific HLA antibodies and their impact on graft function.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Basic&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Genomics and metagenomics investigations of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma in lung transplant recipients.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;
					A mouse orthotopic single&#45;lung transplant model to investigate:
					&lt;ul&gt;
						&lt;li&gt;Primary graft dysfunction lung injury and the mechanisms responsible for increased lung permeability.&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;li&gt;Novel chimeric conditions produced after transplant through lung intravital microscopy.&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;li&gt;The development of models of acute and chronic allograft rejection through the manipulation of transplanted lung MHC repertoire and expression.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;
				&lt;/li&gt;

Our integrated approach to our work allows us to develop evidence in support of programmatic interventions and changes in global health policy.  We provide laboratory consultation, training, and capacity building for molecular epidemiologic based research have on&#45;going collaborations all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Our current projects are funded by a wide variety of sources including The National Institutes of Health, USAID, WHO, Gates Foundation, and other private grant&#45;making groups. We conduct research, provide trainings and technical research and run clinical trials in the US and in several resource&#45;poor countries including Vietnam, Tanzania, Uganda, Zimbabwe and others.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt; Visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://tb.ucsf.edu/&quot;&gt;UCSF TB&lt;/a&gt; for an overview of Tuberculosis Activities at UCSF. &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;hr&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;Clinical Trials&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;The purpose is to conduct clinical research in the areas of diagnosis and treatment of active and latent tuberculosis through multi&#45;phase clinical trials.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;The mission of the TBTC is to conduct programmatically relevant clinical, laboratory and epidemiologic research concerning the diagnosis, clinical management, and prevention of tuberculosis infection and disease. &lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;The aim of this project is to determine whether decentralized TB diagnostic services (mobile&#45;phone based microscopy at health posts and GeneXpert at district health centers) and a community&#45;based education campaign increase TB case detection in Hanoi, Vietnam.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;The goal of this project is to determine the test characteristics of the QFT&#45;GIT with PAMP addition as compared to the standard QFT&#45;GIT in a cohort of patients with active pulmonary TB and in a cohort of healthy patients with no known TB risk factors.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;


			&lt;h3&gt;Laboratory&#45;Based Research&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;This study will determine if nucleic acid amplification tests for Mycobacterium tuberculosis applied to a novel research specimen, oral wash, are accurate and cost&#45;effective for diagnosis of TB in HIV&#45;infected patients and for prediction of the long term risk of treatment failure or relapse.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;This project is collecting preliminary data on the characteristics and kinetics of known mycobacterial proteins on human exosomes in blood and urine in preparation for a larger scale proteomic discovery evaluation and clinical validation of their potential to serve as a surrogate markers of treatment response. &lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;The aim of this project is to compare peripheral and local cytokine responses for the immunodiagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in Kampala, Uganda.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;This research aims to establish whether the genetically diverse strains of M. tuberculosis induce different innate and adaptive responses amongst and between select ethnicities, and thus possibly paving the way for tuberculosis vaccines tailored to specific populations.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;This project uses the molecular technique of RFLP pattern analysis to describe the distribution and dynamics of urban tuberculosis.  It also aims to identify M. TB and human host genes associated with increases in virulence/resistance to infection and disease.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;The goal of this project is to identify genetic mutations in M. tuberculosis that may influence transmissibility and pathogenicity. Because the effects of multidrug resistant (MDR) and extensively drug resistant (XDR) strains on the global tuberculosis epidemic are not yet understood, increased knowledge about the biology and natural history of MDR and XDR strains may be helpful in modeling the disease spread and developing approaches to preventive interventions and treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;This project is directed to evaluating an exosome&#45;focused TB diagnostic using samples provided by the Gates Foundation.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;This grant supports a study of the epidemiology of M. tuberculosis and M. bovis in pastoralist populations in rural Tanzania&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Training&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;This award supports a mentored experience for a junior faculty member in developing biomarkers for TB in high&#45;burden settings.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;The purpose of this project is to establish and operate a center for training and clinical consultation for tuberculosis for the western United States.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;The purpose of this contract is to develop Implementation guides and training modules related to diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis.  &lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Technical Assistance&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;•	The aim of this project is to evaluate a multi&#45;faceted intervention to improve adherence to international guidelines for evaluation of TB suspects at rural health centers in Uganda.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;•	This project provides short&#45; and long&#45;term technical assistance to USAID operating units in implementing and scaling&#45;up priority interventions in accordance with the WHO&#45;recommended STOP TB Strategy and the Global MDR&#45;TB and XDR&#45;TB Response Plan in Tier 1 focus countries.&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;h2&gt;Mucus Study (&quot;MUCGAL&quot;)&lt;/h2&gt;

			&lt;h5&gt;Purpose&lt;/h5&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study is to investigate how abnormal mucus forms in diseases of the airways such as asthma and cystic fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h5&gt;Detailed Description&lt;/h5&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The study protocol involves collection of samples of induced sputum from healthy controls and patients with asthma and cystic fibrosis. Induced sputum is sputum that is coughed up when a solution of salty water is inhaled. The study protocol involves multiple visits for collection of the induced sputum &#45; usually the visit number is between two and 5 but it can be as high as 10. By examining the biochemical and biophysical properties of the sputum samples from different patient groups and also the effects of drugs and chemicals on the sputum after it is collected, we can infer mechanism of disease that may be helpful in developing drugs to treat abnormal mucus.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Please call 1&#45;866&#45;2&#45;INHALE for more information on the MUCGAL study.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
