			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;The UCSF Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism is based on a rich foundation of pioneers, teachers, and visionaries who were thought leaders in their fields. The history of the Division is closely tied to that of the UCSF Diabetes Center. We highlight several of the key events and endocrinologists who were integral to UCSF:&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/sites/endocrine.ucsf.edu/files/images/old_mru.jpg&quot; /&gt;
			&lt;div class=&quot;old_mru&quot;&gt;
				&lt;p style=&quot;padding&#45;top:20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;1949:&lt;/b&gt; The Metabolic Research Unit (MRU) was established by the California State Legislature as an institute for clinical research and training in metabolic and endocrine diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1952:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/about/history/forsham.html&quot;&gt;Peter Forsham.&lt;/a&gt; Dr.Forsham pursued groundbreaking work on diabetes control, pituitary tumors, adrenal disorders, and “bone and stone” diseases. He helped with the development of human insulin and glucagon radioimmunoassays with Gerold Grodsky and John Gerich.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1960:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choh_Hao_Li&quot;&gt;Choh Hao Li&lt;/a&gt;. Hormone Research Institute established at UCSF and combined with Hormone Research Laboratory at Berkeley. Discovery of endorphins, isolation of human growth hormone.&lt;/p&gt;
				
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1968:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/about/history/karam.html&quot;&gt;John Karam.&lt;/a&gt; Dr. Karem was among the first to delineate the role of obesity to the development of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinism in Type II diabetes. He demonstrated the insulin&#45;sparing effects of the biguanides. With Jack Gerich, he helped to define the role of glucagon in normal physiology and diabetic pathophysiology. With Graeme Bell, he was the first to describe a diabetes Type I susceptibility gene (IDDM 2). &lt;/p&gt;
				
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1982:&lt;/b&gt;William Rutter. Director of Hormone Research Institute. His laboratory cloned the insulin gene that helped to create human insulin for pharmacological use. His laboratory also cloned the Insulin receptor and Hepatitis B surface antigen.&lt;/p&gt;
				
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1980:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/about/history/baxter.html&quot;&gt; John Baxter&lt;/a&gt;, Chief of Endocrinology and Metabolism. Dr. Baxter was the first to clone rat, human and bovine growth hormone and prolactin genes and to show that bacteria could produce functional human hormones. This work led to the commercial production of ‘biosynthetic’ human growth hormone that is now used worldwide to treat human growth disorders, and biosynthetic bovine growth hormone which is used throughout the world to improve milk production. His group published the crystal structure of the liganded thyroid hormone receptor (TR) in 1995, the first crystal structure of a small molecule bound to a receptor.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2000:&lt;/b&gt; Diabetes center established at UCSF&lt;/p&gt;

			Endocrinology is the study of hormones and the treatment of hormone based diseases. Metabolism is the study of chemical processes in the body involving carbohydrates, cholesterol and other biochemical substances.
			&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;/div&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
			The endocrine glands in the body produce chemicals called hormones. These hormones are chemical messengers that travel through the blood stream and help control other organs or processes in the body.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;These include growth, metabolism, blood pressure, reproduction, mood, and many other important functions.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The major endocrine glands are the thyroid, pancreas, parathyroid/bone, adrenal, gonads, and pituitary. You may have a hormone disorder if your hormone levels are too high or too low. The UCSF Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism program uses a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to treating hormone&#45;related diseases and metabolic disorders. Members of our department are world renowned and distinguished in their research and clinical care.

			&lt;p&gt; John D. Baxter was a world&#45;renowned physician&#45;scientist who spent his life studying endocrinology and developing new treatments for endocrine and metabolic diseases. He served as Chief of the Division of Endocrinology at UCSF from 1980&#45;97 and Director of the Metabolic Research Unit from 1981&#45;2000.  An early pioneer in recombinant DNA technology, John’s laboratory was first to clone rat, human and bovine growth hormone and prolactin and to show that bacteria could produce functional human hormones. This work led to the commercial production of ‘biosynthetic’ human growth hormone that is now used worldwide to treat human growth disorders, and biosynthetic bovine growth hormone which is used throughout the world to improve milk production. His group published the crystal structure of the liganded thyroid hormone receptor (TR) in 1995, the first crystal structure of a small molecule bound to a receptor. This structure permitted novel, rational drug design, and improved our understanding of ligand&#45;induced conformational changes in the nuclear receptor. In collaboration with Tom Scanlan, he developed TR modulators that selectively target atherosclerosis, serum lipids, obesity and fatty liver. These and related compounds are presently in clinical trials.  John was a member of The Institute of Medicine and The National Academy of Sciences and was an active member of the Endocrine Society, serving as President in 2002 and receiving its highest honor, the Koch Award, in 2007.  He passed away after a short illness in October, 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;img class=&quot;imgLeft&quot; src=&quot;/sites/endocrine.ucsf.edu/files/images/forshamn_bb.jpg&quot; /&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;
				Peter H. Forsham directed the Metabolic Research Unit of the University of California, San Francisco from 1952 until his retirement from the University in 1984. On 15 November 1995 he celebrated his 80th birthday with his daughters Elizabeth and Ann and his former wife, Constance Forsham. Several weeks later, on 5 December 1995, he died suddenly at his residence. Peter Forsham left a remarkable scientific legacy to his colleagues, former students and physicians worldwide who benefited from his many academic accomplishments in endocrinology and diabetes. It was in the latter field particularly that he had a profound impact on the lives and well&#45;being of numerous diabetic patients who owed much to his dedicated care. Diagnosed at the age of nine with insulin&#45;dependent diabetes mellitus, he was among the first to benefit from injections of insulin extracts that had recently been discovered by a Canadian team led by Frederick Banting. Later, as a researcher and physician, Forsham became an early advocate of the concept of avoiding persistent hyperglycemia as a means of preventing the ravages of microvascular diabetic complications. This once&#45;controversial goal of therapy has now been well&#45;established by the results of a large multi&#45;center clinical study known as the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Forsham was born in New Orleans on 15 November 1915. However, just after the end of World War I his family moved to Frankfurt, Germany where he spent his early childhood. It was there in 1925 that he developed juvenile&#45;onset diabetes which required insulin injections over the next 71 years of his life. He attended a French school in Lausanne, Switzerland and earned his bachelor's and master's degrees at Cambridge University in England. In 1939 while doing a research fellowship at Rockefeller University in New York City, World War II began in Europe and he decided to remain in the United States. He was accepted at Harvard Medical College and his career focused on endocrinology. His exceptional talent was rewarded with his being selected as chief of George W. Thorn's research laboratory at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston. It was there that his expertise in the use of adrenocorticotropic hormone and the newly available adrenal cortical hormones blossomed.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In 1952 Forsham was appointed director of the Metabolic Research Unit of the University of California, San Francisco. It was here that he organized teams of scientists working with clinicians to make important contributions to the understanding of the pathophysiology of many endocrine and metabolic disorders. His groups were the first to provide a simple screening test to detect Cushing's syndrome which remains a standard diagnostic procedure today and it was in his unit that Edward Biglieri began his exciting discoveries elucidating the role of the adrenal cortex in endocrine hypertension. The diagnosis and treatment of pituitary tumors, adrenal disorders, and “bone and stone” diseases were among the areas in which his research unit made pivotal findings that kept his outpatient endocrine clinic on the cutting edge of rational therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;However, it was in the investigation of causes and treatment of diabetes that Forsham may have had the most emotional satisfaction. He pursued this goal with an enthusiasm and vigor that inspired his colleagues and brought about many fruitful results. In his Unit, scientists such as Gerold Grodsky and John Gerich developed radioimmunoassays for the peptide hormones insulin and glucagon respectively, and used these assays to unravel mysteries of the secretion of islet hormones and their roles in clinical disorders of carbohydrate metabolism. It was in the Metabolic Research Unit that Gerold Grodsky adapted the perfused pancreas to document for the first time the biphasic nature of glucose&#45;induced insulin secretion, the dependency of insulin secretion on the presence of calcium, and the importance of metabolism of glucose for its induction of insulin release. When his friend Roger Guillemin graciously provided him with some newly discovered somatostatin, Forsham's metabolism group, under the direction of John Gerich, made some original momentous observations about the role of glucagon in a number of the manifestations of hyperglycemia in humans with diabetes and in the metabolic abnormalities of ketoacidosis and hypoglycemia. In 1975 the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation awarded their most prestigious prize, The Rumbough Research Award, to Gerich and Forsham for these outstanding contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Other major awards to Forsham included the 1977 Man of the Year Award by the Editorial Board of Diabetes Forecast, a publication of the American Diabetes Association, and in 1990 he received the Albert Renold Award of the American Diabetes Association for his outstanding record in teaching and in training young investigators. In his office he kept for many years a book overflowing with impressions from some of the one hundred or more scientific research fellows, clinical trainees and medical students who had come to the Metabolic Unit from all over the United States and many parts of the world. Subsequently, many of these contributors have become university professors, leading clinical endocrinologists, and one is currently the president of Kyoto University in Japan. In this book Forsham emerges as an inspiring, imaginative teacher who provided a relaxed, informal congenial atmosphere for free inquiry and encouragement of individual interest. In the book is a poem “The Torch” dedicated to him by a Greek professor who later became Dean of the University of Athens Medical College. In this poem, a procession travels across the earth, holding a torch treasured by its bearers and carrying the “knowledge, humanity, and universal friendship” originating from Forsham's Unit.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The concept of a torch being passed on is particularly symbolic of Forsham's philosophy. When asked why he continued to teach rather than see more patients “who really need him” his reply was simple. “I could see only so many patients a day! However, through all my students combined, I will be able to see hundreds a day all over the world for years to come.” Forsham passed the research torch to his colleague, John Baxter, in whom he instilled the value of always relating basic science to endocrine disorders. Under Baxter's leadership of the Metabolic Research Unit, the torch of Forsham continues to illuminate the darkness, and enlighten endocrinologists about the action of hormones on a molecular level and how this knowledge can be applied to treatment of endocrine disease.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Peter Forsham was a veteran of 71 years of diabetes who inspired diabetic patients of all ages and was living proof of the ability to succeed in spite of the disorder. He thrived on work and maintained a pace which inspired his students and colleagues. Contacts with all varieties of people invigorated him and he was constantly alert to the slightest hint of concern or need in a colleague, student, employee or patient. He was a master at putting their worry in true perspective and his innate optimism and humor were able to dispel the blackest clouds. It was a privilege to have known him and to have worked with him.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Part of the UCSF Metabolic Research Unit and Endocrine Division faculty from 1961 until 2002, John Karam was a clinical investigator, master clinician and educator. He is best remembered as translational scientist bringing clinical insights to his basic science colleagues and interpreting basic science to the clinicians. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p style=&quot;padding&#45;top:20px;&quot;&gt;Participating in two revolutionary waves of scientific discovery, the development of radio&#45;immunoassays and molecular biologic techniques,  John Karam and his colleagues were among the first to catalogue normal and pathophysiologic hormonal patterns and to define the genetic basis of diabetes. In collaboration with Gerald Grodsky, John Karam’s  enduring research included the original observations that hyperinsulinemia  is associated not only with type 2 diabetes  but with obesity alone, even in the absence of diabetes (1&#45;4). Current Contents  recognized these observations as a Citation Classics .  He also was one of the first to demonstrate that  biguanide therapy  reduces insulin resistance and can lower circulating insulin levels (5). In association with Jack Gerich and other members of the Metabolic Research Unit,  Karam helped to define hormonal interaction and metabolic effects,  especially the role of glucagon in normal as well as diabetic states(6&#45;12) . Drawing on his work with Graeme Bell,  Karam was the first to identify that a polymorphism on Chromosome 11 is a major susceptibility gene for type 1 diabetes. (13&#45;15). &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;John Karam’s CV included over 150 significant publications and including 29 chapters on Diabetes Mellitus for  “Current Medical Diagnosis and Treatment”, “Basic and Clinical Endocrinology”, “Basic and Clinical Pharmacology”, and “Currently Emergency, Diagnosis and Treatment “for  the Lange Medical Series.  From 1980 until his retirement in 1993, Karam was the Chief of Clinical Endocrinology.  Over the decades at UCSF he trained scores of housestaff and Endocrine fellows including  dozens of “Dorothy Frank Diabetes Fellows.”  He was received the American Diabetes Association “Outstanding Educator  Award” in 1993.&lt;/p&gt;

			If you would like to visit the physicians and
			professional healthcare team at UCSF Division of Endocrinology's
			practices.&lt;p&gt;
			
			&lt;ol style=&quot;margin&#45;right: 88px&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;
			
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ask your personal physician or referring physician to &lt;a
			href=&quot;/sites/endocrine.ucsf.edu/files/docs/consultation&#45;request.pdf&quot;&gt;request a consultation&lt;/a&gt;.
			Clearly state the reason for the consultation on the form provided.&lt;/b&gt;
			Fax or email the scanned consultation request and relevant labs, notes,
			etc. to &lt;a href=&quot;clinics.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;our offices&lt;/a&gt;. We will need that
			consultation request in order to proceed.&lt;p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
			
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Make sure you have your medical records with you or they can be
			sent to us.&lt;/b&gt;  For you to receive the most beneficial care, it's
			important that the physicians at UCSF can look back at x&#45;rays, test
			reports, and notes from previous healthcare providers. Most physicians
			and healthcare organizations will forward your reports to us if you ask.
			&lt;p&gt;
			
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;In their containers, bring all the medicines that you are
			currently taking with you to your visit.&lt;/b&gt;  We would like you to bring
			the medicines in the bottles that you get from your pharmacy; put all
			the bottles in a paper bag and bring them to your appointment.  A list
			of the medicines or the pills in a pillbox is not sufficient. &lt;p&gt;
			
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you are coming to the diabetes clinic, bring your glucose log
			book and glucose meter.&lt;/b&gt; These are critical to the doctor. &lt;p&gt;
			
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Have your insurance information handy when you call.&lt;/b&gt;  Please
			contact your insurance and be sure you are fully aware of what will or
			will not be covered.  Any authorizations required by the insurance are
			the responsibility of the patient and the referring physician. &lt;p&gt;
			
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Make a list of your questions.&lt;/b&gt;  At UCSF, we'll try to explain
			everything you'll need to know about your individual treatment plan.
			However, if you have a question, it's best to write it down to refer to
			during your appointment. We want to make sure we address any and all of
			your concerns. &lt;p&gt;
			
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Examine traveling routes and, if necessary, &lt;a
			href=&quot;http://www.ucsfhealth.org/adult/patient_guide/services/
			accommodations.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reserve lodgings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;  If, like  many of our
			patients, you are not familiar with San Francisco, please refer to the
			&lt;a
			href=&quot;http://www.ucsfhealth.org/adult/patient_guide/services/
			ourhospitals.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;directions and maps&lt;/a&gt; on the main &lt;a
			href=&quot;http://www.ucsfhealth.org/adult/patient_guide/services/
			ourhospitals.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;UCSF Medical Center&lt;/a&gt; website. If you are going to
			be staying overnight, make sure to make your plans and call hotels early
			for reservations. &lt;p&gt;
			
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;And, Relax.&lt;/b&gt;  At UCSF, you'll have a team of professionals
			working to provide you with the most up&#45;to&#45;date treatment appropriate
			for your medical condition. &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;br&gt;

			fourth in the nation and the best in California by U.S. News &amp; World
			Report. &lt;/a&gt; Our endocrinology and metabolism services include comprehensive
			consultation and treatment for patients with known or suspected diseases
			of the endocrine system, such as diabetes, hypothalamic and pituitary
			disease, adrenal disease, amenorrhea, hirsutism, sexual dysfunction,
			osteoporosis and metabolic bone disease, abnormalities of the thyroid
			and parathyroid glands, renal stones, and lipid disorders.&lt;p&gt;
			
			Our goal is to provide expert consultation and compassionate care. We bring
			questions that arise during consultation to the research laboratory to
			enhance our understanding of disease and to develop new approaches to
			treatment. We then bring the advances of the laboratory back to our
			patients.&lt;p&gt;
			
			Members of our department are world renowned and distinguished
			for their research and treatment of diabetes, osteoporosis, adrenal
			disease, thyroid disease, and pituitary disease.&lt;p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;hr align=center width=33% color=#CC6600&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Endocrinology is the study of hormones and the treatment of hormone based diseases. The endocrine glands
			produce chemicals called hormones. These hormones are released into the
			blood stream and exert their action by stimulating other organs in the
			body. The major endocrine glands are the thyroid, pancreas, parathyroid,
			adrenal, gonad and pituitary. The hormones from these glands regulate
			growth, metabolism, blood pressure, reproduction as well as many other
			necessary functions.

Diabetes Program ./endocrine/care/referrals/diabetes.html

		<FileBody>
			&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;width:400px;margin&#45;left:10px;&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/endocrine.ucsf.edu/files/images/diabetes_team.jpg&quot; class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot; style=&quot;width:404px;&quot;&gt;Diabetes team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Most recent estimates by the California Diabetes Program were that 42,265 residents of San Francisco have diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Over 20% of those patients (8,700) are in the San Francisco Department of Public Health diabetes registry receiving primary care in DPH clinics.  There are several thousand other patients receiving primary care in the consortium of safety net clinics that are not part of the DPH and still more patients with diabetes in the city that are not receiving usual care who arrive in our urgent care and emergency department.  Thus, the SFGH Diabetes clinic is the referral center for as many as 25% or more of the city’s patients with diabetes.  We obviously don’t have the capacity to see every patient with diabetes and nor would that be appropriate. Thus the focus of diabetes care within the division has broadened over the last five years from a sole focus on individual visits to include a strong emphasis on support for primary care providers, who are providing the majority of diabetes care in the patients’ medical homes.  &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Guiding Goals and Principles&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Multi&#45;disciplinary care focused on barriers to self&#45;management, nutrition, and mental health issues
			Support primary care diabetes management through guidelines, education and novel patient education tools
			Get patients to goal quickly
			Target early insulin use overcoming patient and provider barriers
			Increase access to intensive diabetes management 
			Develop cost effective strategies&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Clinical Activities&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;In 2008, via Healthy San Francisco funding, there was a significant expansion of the diabetes program.  Three part&#45;time NPs with diabetes expertise (1.5 FTE total) were hired and The Diabetes Center for High Risk Populations was launched.  Our weekly diabetes clinic is multidisciplinary with MDs, NPs, a diabetes educator, a nutritionist and a mental health worker available to see patients.   In addition we’ve added an NP clinic focused on intensive insulin management and have explored alternative care options including Spanish group medical visits at the Family Health Center, Cantonese group medical visits at Ocean Park Health Center, post gestational diabetes postpartum group medical visits, a monthly half day diabetes clinic at the jail, and monthly insulin start groups in English and Spanish to overcome patient fears around insulin.  Unfortunately data on our NP and group visits are not easily obtained due to the use of different visit coding.  Data for nine months in 2010 that includes the majority of NP visits shows they have added more than 1000 visits a year, more than doubling our diabetes visit volume since 2006.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Outreach &lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The diabetes team has staffed diabetes education days and screening days in conjunction with primary care clinics, churches and department of public health initiatives throughout the city.  In addition we’ve visited over 15 Department of Public Health clinics and independent safety net clinics to do provider trainings and education.  In 2011 we obtained funding to conduct a free, daylong CME event for safety net clinics (discussed in more detail under education).&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Examples of Guidelines and Tools Generated&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;With a new emphasis an assisting primary care providers, the Diabetes Team has developed resources to help standardize care and help patients get to goal more quickly.
			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oral medication guideline pocket card, focused on rapid medication titration allowing for more uniform care among providers
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Standardized RN protocol allowing an RN to do oral medication titration based on the guideline without the need for a PCP visit
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low literacy insulin teaching flip chart focused on addressing patient fears around insulin (possible by funding from the SFGH Foundation)
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bimonthly electronic diabetes newsletter for PCPs in the safety net providing updates on formulary changes, summary of new studies, updates from the American Diabetes Association
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Web based resources on the intranet&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;This procedure has traditionally been done during the regular endocrine clinic sessions.  &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;FNA&#45;only clinic sessions began sporadically in 2008 and currently those sessions are every other week. FNA volume has increased from 11 in 2006 to 108 in 2011.   Performing this procedure in endocrine clinic rather than radiology allows for more coordinated thyroid nodule care for the patient and currently provides the primary source of thyroid FNA training for our endocrine fellows.  &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;From FY 07&#45;08 to 10&#45;11 there has been significant expansion in endocrine services as measured by all available metrics. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt; Total visits per year have increased approximately 25% from 1605 to 2004.  “New patients seen” has shown a similar increase from 237 to 316 patients a year.  In FY 2010&#45;2011 e&#45;referral has allowed for evaluation, assessment and recommendation of a treatment plan with co&#45;management for an additional 300+ patients who were never seen in endocrine clinic (45% of referrals to endocrine are never scheduled). &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Staffed with a nutritionist, the clinic is heavily focused on lifestyle modification in conjunction with medical therapy.  The clinic continues to receive support from the Gladstone without which, it will be difficult to sustain.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;For over 50 years, the Division of Endocrinology at UCSF Medical Center at Parnassus has been an international leader in both clinical endocrinology and basic endocrine research.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Our goals remain simple. We bring the questions and unknowns from our patient's bedside to the research laboratory, to not only help improve our understanding of disease process, but to bring about new therapeutic modalities. We then bring the advances of the laboratory back to our patients.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Members of our divisions are world recognized and distinguished in their research and treatment. Our clinics and staff handle a wide range of hormone disorders, both common and unusual cases, including thyroid disorders, pituitary disorders, adrenal disorders, calcium and bone disorders, diabetes mellitus (both type 1 and type 2), and lipid disorders.  We also perform ultrasound guided biopsy of thyroid nodules.  We collaborate with various excellent departments including Endocrine Surgery, Head and Neck Endocrine Surgery, Neurosurgery, Nuclear Medicine, Pathology, Radiology, and Radiation Oncology to serve and treat our patients.  &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Services Available&lt;/h3&gt; 
			&lt;p&gt;The Endocrine&#45;Metabolism Service at the San Francisco Dept of Veterans Affairs Medical Center has General Endocrine clinics on Monday, Thursday, and Friday mornings. At these clinics, care is provided for the entire spectrum of endocrine disorders including diabetes, lipid disorders, osteoporosis, thyroid problems, calcium disorders, adrenal and pituitary disease, and gonadal disorders. Tuesday morning the Endocrine&#45;Metabolism Service has a joint clinic with the endocrine surgeons where patients who may need endocrine surgery for thyroid, parathyroid, and adrenal disorders are evaluated together with surgeons. On Tuesday afternoon the Endocrine&#45;Metabolism Service has a joint clinic with bariatric surgeons where patients are evaluated for bariatric surgery, and patients who have already had surgery are closely followed. Finally, the Endocrine&#45;Metabolism Service will also evaluate obese patients and provide medical therapy and nutritional referrals to assist in weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Expertise&lt;/h3&gt; 
			&lt;p&gt;The San Francisco Dept of Veterans Affairs Medical Center has 5 full&#45; time staff endocrinologists that provide and supervise the management and care of patients with endocrine disorders. The staff has particular expertise in the care of patients with diabetes, lipid disorders, osteoporosis, calcium disorders, thyroid diseases, endocrine surgery, and bariatric surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;To obtain care at the VA one first needs to be approved for this benefit. To be approved, a veteran can go to the San Francisco Dept of Veterans Affairs Medical Center (4150 Clement Street, San Francisco, CA 94121) and meet with a Members Service advisor or one can fill out and submit an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.1010ez.med.va.gov/sec/vha/1010ez/Form/1010ez.pdf&quot;&gt;application on&#45;line&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Members Services telephone numbers are (415) 221&#45;4810 ext. 5907 and 4066.  Once a patient is approved he or she is assigned a primary care provider who can refer the patient with the endocrine disorder to one of the Endocrine&#45;Metabolism Clinics for evaluation and care.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;If you are already a patient in the VA system, you can ask your primary care provider or other providers that you are maybe seeing to refer you to the endocrine clinic for the care of an endocrine disorder.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;The Integrated Fellowship Training Program in Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism (DEM) at the University of California, San Francisco is designed for physicians who have completed internship and residency training in Internal Medicine and are interested in a career in academic medicine as clinician scientists and educators. This fully ACGME&#45;accredited program consists of one exclusively clinical year, followed by two years of endocrine research. Trainees qualify for ABIM specialty board certification in Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism and obtain sufficient research experience to pursue a career in academic medicine. Our trainees go on to careers in academic medicine, endocrine clinical practice and the pharmaceutical/biotechnology industry, with a track record of appointments in highly competitive positions. In general, preference for acceptance into the program is given to those qualified applicants who wish to pursue a career in academic medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Clinical Training&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The first year of the fellowship focuses exclusively on clinical training in Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism.  There are separate divisions of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://medschool2.ucsf.edu/sfgh/san&#45;francisco&#45;general&#45;hospital&#45;and&#45;trauma&#45;center&quot;&gt;San Francisco General Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sanfrancisco.va.gov/&quot;&gt;San Francisco Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ucsfhealth.org/&quot;&gt;UCSF Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;. The clinical year consists of four&#45;month rotations at each of the three hospitals. These rotations involve extensive inpatient and outpatient exposure to the full spectrum of problems in endocrinology and metabolism including disorders of the thyroid, adrenal, hypothalamus, pituitary, parathyroids, and gonads; endocrine hypertension; metabolic bone and calcium disorders; type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity and lipid disorders; and outpatient exposure to pediatric endocrinology. Fellows are also trained in thyroid ultrasound and fine needle aspiration biopsy and in insulin pump and chronic glucose monitoring technology.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Training throughout emphasizes outpatient endocrinology and consultative endocrinology. Approximately 40% of a fellow's clinical year is spent in endocrinology subspecialty clinics, including general endocrine, diabetes, lipid, thyroid, metabolic bone, pediatric endocrine, obesity and endocrine surgery clinics. The clinical year gives trainees broad exposure to a large cadre of full&#45;time and part&#45;time clinical faculty (&gt; 75 faculty members) with specialized expertise in these problems.  Fellows attend weekly didactic sessions and lead weekly clinical conferences throughout the year. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;All fellows have an Endocrine Continuity Clinic for three years. This ensures them the opportunity to follow patients long enough to witness the natural history of endocrine disease and its therapy unfold. Fellows in their third year have the opportunity to attend elective clinics in reproductive endocrinology, neuroendocrinology, thyroid biopsy, thyroid cancer and obstetric diabetes and endocrinology.  Clinics have associated conferences supplemented with in&#45;depth individualized faculty training and mentoring. All fellows attend the monthly Endocrine Fellows&#45;Faculty Journal Club. Fellows are encouraged and supported to attend one national meeting in diabetes, endocrinology, and metabolism in their second and third years.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Research Training&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The second and third years of the fellowship focus on training in DEM research.  Plans for research training and selection of research mentors are discussed with the Program Director, Career Mentors and endocrine faculty during the first year of the fellowship. The UCSF DEM faculty includes approximately 75 distinguished researchers, clinicians and educators at UCSF drawn from multiple academic departments and representing every discipline within endocrinology and metabolism and their related basic and clinical sciences. Fellows can also choose mentors outside of this group, but then need to choose a co&#45;mentor from among the DEM faculty.  Examples of the breadth of research opportunities available to trainees are illustrated by the attached research summaries.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Research training in the DEM Program is primarily funded by an NIH Training Grant from the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases, and typically follows one of two pathways, the Basic Scientist Pathway and the Clinical Investigator Pathway. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Basic Scientist Pathway&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Recognizing that our pool of fellows consists of individuals with disparate backgrounds in science and research, there are several options for training in basic research.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;One option consists of practical training in the laboratory of an established bench investigator supplemented by formal courses in cell biology, molecular biology, genetics, immunology, biochemistry, or other topics offered through the UCSF graduate programs [e.g., the Biomedical Sciences (BMS) Program or the Program in Biological Sciences (PIBS)].&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;A second option, often pursued by endocrine fellows with previous research experience, is to have their research training experience take place in the laboratory of their chosen mentor, supplemented with ongoing seminars and conferences in that laboratory or department. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;A third option is to apply to the UCSF Molecular Medicine Training Program (MMTP) for internship and residency with subsequent tracking into the DEM Fellowship Training Program. This competitive institution&#45;wide program provides advanced training in the experimental study of the molecular and cellular basis of disease. This is done through individual laboratory research, lectures, seminars and journal clubs. In addition, through an individual advisory/mentoring system, the program provides guidance and advice about the practicalities of pursuing a career at the interface of science and medicine. Many DEM faculty mentors are also MMTP faculty.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;As a fourth option, trainees may choose to pursue a PhD degree in the BMS Program at UCSF, an elite graduate program in integrative biology with an emphasis on the study of human disease. One can apply to this program before or after arriving on campus. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Clinical Investigator Pathway&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Like the Basic Scientist Pathway, this program recognizes the disparate training needs of our fellows and consists of a combination of mentored research experience and formal training. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The clinical research training experience is planned by the fellow in conjunction with his/her chosen research mentor, Career Mentor and Program Director.  Available research projects span the full range of clinical investigation, from clinical trials performed in the clinical research facilities of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ctsi.ucsf.edu/&quot;&gt;UCSF Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI)&lt;/a&gt; to studies in epidemiology and biostatistics using massive international data bases, and cover topics such as hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular endocrinology, osteoporosis, growth hormone therapy, thyroid cancer, pituitary and adrenal disorders, wasting syndromes, obesity, and type 1 and 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Fellows in the Clinical Investigator Pathway can supplement their research training with coursework through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://accelerate.ucsf.edu/training/training&quot;&gt;UCSF Training in Clinical Research (TICR) Program&lt;/a&gt;, which provides a spectrum of training covering basic clinical study design, biostatistics, epidemiology and medical ethics. These courses are available individually or as part of larger programs awarding a certificate or masters degree in clinical research. 
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;How to Apply&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Applicants interested in applying to the program should apply a year prior to the desired start date.  Applications are accepted exclusively through the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS), which also provides instructions and application deadlines.  Invitations to selected applicants for interviews are generally issued within a few weeks of the receipt of your application. We will schedule your interview on one of two Saturday interview days at the UCSF Medical Center Campus on Parnassus Avenue. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;For specific questions about the DEM program, research opportunities in a specific field, or the application process, you are encouraged to contact the &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:Sarina.Weinstein@ucsf.edu&quot;&gt;DEM Program Coordinator&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Philanthropy plays a crucial role in supporting the activities of the Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism.  Our faculty provide the best possible care to our patients, conduct leading&#45;edge research and train the next generation of medical professionals. Your gift to the Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism will allow us to continue this commitment to excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h2&gt;Philanthropic Oppurtunities&lt;/h2&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;We are focusing on two key priorities to maintain our position as a leader in the provision of outstanding clinical care, leading biomedical research, and training to the next generation of talented endocrinologists.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Fellowships&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The years of clinical training immediately following the completion of a medical residency is a formative time for young physicians. The Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism is home to the top endocrine fellows in the country, and our graduates go on to faculty and leadership positions in leading academic medical institutions and the pharmaceutical/biotech industry.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Our endocrine fellows are supported by fellowships that cover tuition, fees, and living expenses. Such fellowships – approximately $250,000 per fellow over three years – are funded through a mix of grant support and private philanthropy. Private investment in endocrinology fellowships enables UCSF to offer highly competitive packages and maintain our stellar research and teaching programs to attract the very best candidates. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Innovative Research and Faculty Support Endowments&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;We cannot take our scientific leadership for granted. The time and focus required to push discoveries forward in the complex world of endocrinology is daunting, particularly when combined with the burden of applying for grants to keep promising research funded. Funds for research and faculty support  – and  endowments in particular – allow our faculty to do what they do best: pursue cutting&#45;edge and innovative research in the service of their patients.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;How You Can Help&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;There are a variety of ways to support the Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism including outright gifts, pledges, and planned gifts.  To make a gift, visit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://makeagift.ucsf.edu/site/SPageServer?pagename=A1_API_CustomGivingForm&amp;Primary=Department%20of%20Medicine&amp;ACode=B3157&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;UCSF Make A Gift website&lt;/a&gt; or contact Eileen Murphy, Executive Director of University Development at (415) 476&#45;5618, or &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:eileen.murphy@ucsf.edu&quot;&gt;eileen.murphy@ucsf.edu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;b&gt;Autoimmune Endocrine Disease  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			My research focuses on the genetic factors involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune endocrine disease. One area of current interest involves an animal model of the human autoimmune disease called APECED. This is a clinical disease that is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion and is characterized by autoimmunity involving multiple endocrine organs. The causative gene for this disorder called Aire  was cloned by positional cloning. We have generated an animal model of this disease by knocking out the murine homologue of this gene. Aire&#45;deficient mice exhibit immune cell infiltrates in multiple organs, and recent studies in my laboratory have shown that the general defect responsible for this disease involves thymic selection of T cells. This selection defect appears to involve the inability of thymic medullary epithelial cells to transcribe self&#45;antigens in the thymus for presentation to self&#45;antigen specific thymocytes. Studies are ongoing examining how this process affects immune tolerance in a number of disease models, including autoimmune diabetes. In addition, the genetic background in which the knockout gene is expressed alters the pattern and severity of the autoimmune disease in the mouse model. Studies are underway to map the genes that specifically influence these differences. We are also generating other animal models of autoimmunity using similar gene targeting techniques. Specifically, we are interested in targeting genes in an animal model of type I diabetes, the NOD mouse strain. &lt;/p&gt;
			A second area of interest is the examination of candidate genes responsible for the risk to develop type I diabetes. The approach in these studies has been to use case&#45;control collections and testing of SNPs in candidate genes for their potential contribution to disease risk. Studies are currently ongoing, but several excellent candidates have been identified, and confirmatory testing in a second case&#45;control population is underway. Mechanistic experiments for the identified risk genes are also planned to follow up these findings. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;b&gt;Replication of RNA Viruses and Their Interactions  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
			We study processes that lead to replication of RNA viruses and their interactions with the host. In one project, we concentrate on the study of poliovirus translation, RNA replication, and genome packaging. We have focused on a ribonucleoprotein complex that forms at the 5'&#45;end of the viral RNA. This complex is composed of the first 100 nucleotides of the genomic RNA, a viral&#45;encoded protein, and a ribosomal&#45;associated cellular factor. The structural details and specific function of the complex have yet to be defined. Mutations that disrupt the formation of this complex reduce the synthesis of positive strand viral RNA, and also greatly affect translation. To analyze the function of this complex in vivo, we have developed a system in which to study poliovirus replication. Microinjection of viral RNA into Xenopus laevis oocytes initiates a complete and authentic viral replication cycle, which yields a high level of infectious viruses, but only if polioviral RNA is co&#45;injected with factors present in HeLa cells. Two additional mammalian cell factors are required for viral replication in oocytes: one involved in initiation of translation and the other in RNA synthesis. Thus, microinjection in oocytes can be used, essentially, as an in vitro system in which to identify and further analyze the function of viral and cellular factors and biochemically dissect mechanisms of poliovirus synthesis. &lt;/p&gt;
			More recently, we have also started to examine the role of genetic diversity on a virus population and its consequences for virus fitness, adaptation and pathogenesis. The quasispecies hypothesis postulates that genomic variation in RNA virus populations enhances fitness by facilitating adaptation to changing environments encountered during infection. To test this theory, we examined whether limiting genomic diversity affects viral fitness and pathogenesis. A variant of the poliovirus RNA&#45;dependent RNA polymerase (3D pol ) that enhances replication fidelity reduces diversity within the virus population. The high fidelity mutant replicates at wildtype levels but is unable to adapt to adverse growth conditions. In infected animals, the reduced genomic diversity led to restricted tissue tropism and an attenuated pathogenic phenotype. Importantly, expanding the quasispecies of the high fidelity mutant by chemical mutagenesis prior to infection restored tissue tropism and pathogenesis to wildtype levels. This study provides direct evidence for the quasispecies theory and establishes a compelling link between mutation rate, population fitness and pathogenesis. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;b&gt;Mechanisms and Modulation of the Thyroid Hormone Receptor &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			Our research focuses on the molecular and structural biology of the thyroid hormone receptor (TR) and mechanisms whereby the receptor can be modulated. Dr. Paul Webb is heavily involved as a collaborator and co&#45;investigator in most of this work&lt;/p&gt; 
			
			
			One effort is the elucidation of structures of the TR in collaboration with Dr. Robert Fletterick's group. We were the first group to obtain the structure of a liganded nuclear receptor. This structure was a complete surprise in that it revealed that the ligand was buried in the receptor's interior. This observation immediately suggested mechanisms for how the ligand binds, how antagonists work and how ligand binding transmits information to the receptor to mediate post&#45;binding actions of receptors. Since then, we have determined a number of additional structures of native and mutated TR ligand binding domains. These structures have revealed: mechanisms for ligand selectivity in binding to the 2 TR isoforms (TRa and TR!!editedcontent!!) that has been useful for developing TRE&#45;selective compounds now in human clinical trials (see below); how the receptor interacts with coactivators; mechanisms for the syndrome of resistance to thyroid hormone; and the identification of many unexpected conformations that the receptor may adopt to accommodate various ligands that, in addition, has been useful for pharmaceutical design.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			A major effort is underway to use the X&#45;ray crystal structures to direct placement of mutations that provide more information about receptor function. Surface&#45;scanning mutagenesis allowed us to first define the structure of the coactivator binding surface and know the mechanism of how ligand binding generates the surface. We later learned that the detailed mechanisms for binding of various coactivators differ, thereby, providing mechanisms for coactivator specificity. We learned the structure of the corepressor binding surface and mechanisms whereby the corepressor could displace helix 12 of the ligand binding domain. We defined the surfaces that form homodimers with other TRs and heterodimers with the retinoid X&#45;receptors (RXRs) and made the unexpected discovery that ligand binding promotes partial rearrangement of the dimer/heterodimer surface. We also have found that the RXR ligand binding domain must swivel with respect to its DNA binding domain to form heterodimers on certain DNA elements.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			The structural data has been a stimulus to design unique ligands interacting through the TR in collaboration with Dr. Thomas Scanlan's group and other scientists. We designed the first TR antagonists that we hope some day will be used to diminish features of hyperthyroidism rapidly, unlike current therapies which usually require weeks to take effect. We have designed TR!!editedcontent!! and tissue uptake selective compounds that lower cholesterol in rodents and monkeys by promoting lowering of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and steps in reverse cholesterol transport and also promote fat loss without muscle or bone loss or effects on the heart. We are determining mechanisms for the selectivity and the means to tailor these compounds to have even more selectivity. One of these compounds is now in human clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;b&gt; Influence of Lifestyle on Heart Disease Risk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			Coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke account for approximately one&#45;third of all deaths in the United States. About 90% of patients with these conditions have at least one of the four major risk factors for heart disease and stroke&#45;high cholesterol levels, hypertension, smoking, and diabetes mellitus. Motivating people to adopt a heart&#45;healthy lifestyle (regular exercise and diet to maintain optimal cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and body weight) is key to CHD and stroke prevention&lt;/p&gt; 
			&lt;/p&gt;
			In the Turkish Heart Study, our ongoing epidemiological study of CHD risk factors, we have observed a lifestyle&#45;induced change in the most prevalent heart disease risk factor of Turks: low levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL&#45;C). Ten years ago, 75% of Turkish men and 50% of women had HDL&#45;C levels &lt;40 mg/dl, and the average levels (36 mg/dl in men and 42 mg/dl in women) were 10&#45;15 mg/dl lower than those in Americans. The effect on CHD risk, which increases by 2&#45;4% for every 1&#45;mg/dl decrease in HDL&#45;C levels, is substantial.
			
			Between our 1990&#45;1993 and 2003 surveys of Turks living in Istanbul, we found that HDL&#45;C levels increased in women only, and in 2003 but not 1990&#45;1993, there was a significant association of education and socioeconomic status with higher HDL&#45;C levels. University&#45;educated women had higher average HDL&#45;C levels than those with only a primary school education (56 &amp;plusmn; 9 versus 48 &amp;plusmn; 12 mg/dl). The higher levels were significantly associated with lower weight (body mass index of 25.6 &amp;plusmn; 49 versus 29.7 &amp;plusmn; 5.1 kg/m 2 ), less cigarette smoking, and more exercise. In men, however, HDL&#45;C levels were only slightly (~2 mg/dl) modulated by exercise, smoking, or education. The gender&#45;related difference in the response of HDL&#45;C to these lifestyle factors remains to be explained, but great potential exists for reducing the CHD risk of Turkish women by increasing education and socioeconomic status. As much as a 20&#45;30% reduction in CHD risk might be expected in association with the 8 mg/dl difference in HDL&#45;C levels of more highly educated Turkish women.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;b&gt;Regulation of Intestinal Calcium Transport by Vitamin D &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			We are currently focused on the mechanisms by which 1,25(OH) 2 D regulates the flow of calcium across the intestinal brush border. We are evaluating the interacting roles of the newly discovered TRPV6 (a vitamin D&#45;regulated calcium channel specific for the brush border), calmodulin (CaM) (the major calcium binding protein in the brush border), and myosin 1 (a single headed myosin unique to the brush border which uses CaM as its light chain) in this process. We are using a cell culture model (Caco2 cells) as well as mice null for TRPV6, myosin1, the vitamin D receptor, and the 25OHD 1a&#45;hydroxylase for these studies.
			&lt;/p&gt; 
			
			&lt;b&gt;Effect of Skeletal Unloading on Bone Formation  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			The fundamental observation that we are trying to understand is why skeletal unloading leads to a cessation of bone formation. We are trying to understand the signals by which this takes place. Skeletal unloading results in resistance to the anabolic actions of IGF&#45;I. This resistance is due to a failure of IGF&#45;I to activate its receptor in the osteoblasts from unloaded bone. Integrins are part of this mechanism in that integrin expression is reduced in cells from unloaded bone and blocking integrin function duplicates the resistance to IGF&#45;I seen in unloaded bone. The mechanism(s) underlying the role of integrins in IGF&#45;I activation of its receptor is being investigated. We have also been studying IGF&#45;I and IGF&#45;I receptor null mice and determined that such mice are resistant to the anabolic actions of parathyroid hormone. In more recent studies with these mice, we have discovered that IGF&#45;I is essential for normal osteoclast development as well as osteoblast differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;b&gt;Regulation of Keratinocyte Differentiation by Calcium and Vitamin D&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			We made the initial discovery that keratinocytes are prodigious producers not only of vitamin D but also its active metabolite 1,25(OH) 2 D. Our recent efforts have been directed toward understanding the mechanisms by which 1,25(OH) 2 D and calcium regulate differentiation of these cells. In the course of these investigations, we discovered the central importance of the calcium receptor and PLC&#45;?1 in the differentiation process and determined their regulation by 1,25(OH) 2 D and calcium. Furthermore, we have extensively studied the involucrin gene, which encodes a critical component of the cornified envelope, and discovered a region in its promoter that confers both calcium and 1,25(OH) 2 D responsiveness. We have gained insight into the ability of 1,25(OH) 2 D to induce sequentially the genes required for differentiation of keratinocytes (and the failure of same in squamous cell carcinoma) by showing that the vitamin D receptor changes its binding to coactivator complexes from DRIP to SRC during the differentiation process and that the vitamin D response elements in the genes required for differentiation prefer the VDR/SRC complex for their induction. The shift from DRIP to SRC binding does not occur in squamous cell carcinoma in that DRIP 205 is overexpressed, blocking the transition to SRC coactivation, and so blocking the induction of genes required for differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;b&gt;Events That Regulate T&#45;cell Activation and Development during Immune
			Responses &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			My research concerns the fundamental events that regulate T&#45;cell
			activation and development during immune responses to autoantigens and
			transplantation antigens. Our efforts have focused on understanding the
			basic processes that control T cell activation and tolerance. We hope
			that the insights gained from these studies will help in the development
			of a new generation of toleragenic drugs that will &quot;turn off&quot; selected
			parts of the immune system, leaving the disease&#45;fighting capabilities
			intact. 
			
			&lt;p&gt;Our efforts to modulate T cell activation have centered on
			understanding and altering the positive signals delivered by the
			antigen&#45;specific T cell receptor and secondary, so&#45;called co&#45;stimulatory
			signals (e.g., CD28 and CD40L), or engaging the negative regulatory
			events such as CTLA&#45;4, PD&#45;1 and Notch that control T cell signal
			transduction. We have used soluble receptor antagonists, monoclonal
			antibodies and animals deficient in individual members of the CD28/B7
			pathway to define their individual roles in transplant rejection and
			autoimmunity. In addition, we study CD4+CD25+ cells which play a
			critical role in the regulation of autoimmune diabetes.
			
			&lt;p&gt;Additional
			efforts in the lab have yielded insights into the function of the CD28
			homologue, CTLA&#45;4. CTLA&#45;4 engagement is essential in the development and
			maintenance of T cell tolerance in the autoimmune setting. Importantly,
			this molecule exists in spliced variants that function differentially at
			different stages of immunity. We have begun to elucidate the biochemical
			basis of this regulatory signal through its interaction with the TCR
			complex. &lt;p&gt;
			
			&lt;b&gt;Clinical Research Program&lt;/b&gt; 
			&lt;p&gt;We developed a novel, genetically
			engineered &quot;humanized&quot;, form of an anti&#45;CD3 mAb for use in solid organ
			transplantation and autoimmunity. We have shown in animal models that
			this class of monoclonal antibodies can induce T cells into a state of
			unresponsiveness that leads to long term T cell tolerance to foreign and
			self antigens. In human studies, we have shown that a humanized OKT3 g 1
			(Ala&#45;Ala) delays disease progression in type 1 diabetes and psoriatic
			arthritis. 
			
			&lt;p&gt;We have started the JDRF Center for Islet Transplantation, a
			comprehensive research and clinical program aimed at producing rapid
			clinical advances in islet transplantation. The Center combines
			cutting&#45;edge programs in both immunobiology and transplant biology with
			established clinical expertise in islet transplantation and monitoring
			technology. In addition, we have developed a Collaborative Center for
			Cell Therapy designed to promote basic and clinical research that will
			lead to successful antigen&#45;specific regulatory T cell therapy in
			patients. The goals of these centers are to develop and exploit novel
			tolerogenic drugs for the treatment of type 1 diabetes. 
			
			&lt;p&gt;I founded and
			direct the Immune Tolerance Network created in 1999 to accelerate the
			clinical development of immune tolerance therapies. This
			interdisciplinary research network develops clinical trials in organ
			transplantation, autoimmune diseases and allergy, and asthma. Including
			the ITN's advisory panels, the ITN is comprised of over 80 leaders in
			immune tolerance, from over 40 institutions spanning 9 countries.
			Industry, academic and government investigators all participate and
			there are currently over 20 clinical trials and 12 mechanism&#45;based
			studies approved and underway. The ITN is dedicated to the sharing of
			information in a very broad sense, where possible, making unique ITN
			resources and protocols available to the immunology community at large.
			It is a key goal of the ITN to further define the mechanisms of immune
			tolerance in the human clinical setting. Each clinical trial is
			supplemented by a comprehensive set of assay studies seeking knowledge
			of tolerance and biological indications of therapeutic effect. In
			addition, we have created the ITN Registry of Tolerant Kidney Transplant
			Recipients, a world&#45;wide database of patients who have maintained kidney
			grafts despite the cessation of all immunosuppression. Investigators
			seek to establish new biological markers that indicate the presence or
			proclivity of tolerance. 
			
			&lt;p&gt;Thus, in summary, my lab has been involved in
			efforts to modify transplantation and autoimmune responses and
			understand the underlying mechanisms of T cell recognition of foreign
			antigens. Using this information we hope to develop novel tolerogenic
			therapies that can be tested in man&lt;/p&gt;

			We are investigating oncogenic signaling processes leading to the growth of various solid tumors and their invasion and metastasis. One research focus is to establish the clinical utility of certain signaling molecules [e.g. hyaluronan (HA) and CD44 (a HA receptor)] as important tumor markers for early detection and/or diagnostic/prognostic tools. In addition, we are in the process of designing novel signaling perturbation strategies and potential therapeutic procedures as new drug targets to inhibit the spread and progression of various solid tumor cancers. Another area of our research interest is to investigate the role of HA&#45; CD44 signaling in regulating epidermal keratinocyte and bone cell differentiation. We believe that the new knowledge obtained from these studies could provide useful insights into direct therapeutic treatments in both skin and bone disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;b&gt;Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; Polycystic ovarian syndrome
			(PCOS), a disorder characterized by abnormal menstrual cycles and
			evidence of increased male hormone production, is the most common
			endocrinopathy affecting women. It is estimated that 5&#45;10% of
			reproductive age women may have some variant of this disease process.
			Increasingly, an association between insulin resistance and PCOS has
			been described. It remains unclear whether insulin is associated with
			the mechanism of anovulation in PCOS. This insulin resistance does
			appear, however, to increase the risk for development of diabetes and
			cardiovascular disease. This increased risk, and its significant impact
			on long&#45;term morbidity and mortality, make the understanding of this
			disease process critically important to public health.
			
			&lt;p&gt;We envision the development of a combined clinical and basic science
			program for the study of PCOS. As part of this multiprong approach, we
			will continue studies currently underway with a cohort of young women
			followed from age 9 to 19. Current investigations will ascertain whether
			insulin resistance is critical to disease development. In studying this
			cohort, our aim is to facilitate a better understanding of the factors
			responsible for the development and progression of the disease, as well
			as, allowing for subsequent prospective studies with the intent of
			preventing disease development. Further, we have established a
			multi&#45;disciplinary group of investigators to develop a comprehensive
			PCOS Clinic. This facility will establish data and tissue banks and
			serve as a resource for future clinical investigation.
			
			&lt;p&gt;PCOS patients are almost always infertile as their failure to ovulate
			prevents a scheduled pregnancy. The mechanism(s) responsible for the
			arrest of egg development in PCOS is not well understood. Studies
			suggest the presence of a local factor that may inhibit follicle
			stimulating hormone (FSH). Most of the prior studies utilized ovaries
			obtained at the time of gynecologic surgery. Thus once removed, they
			were not available for further manipulation and re&#45;evaluation. Our
			approach is to directly sample the follicular environment in the intact
			subject, with the opportunity to apply pharmacologic intervention
			(agents which lower insulin levels +/&#45; agents which decrease androgen
			production) followed by re&#45;sampling. This will enable us to directly
			assess the effect(s) of changes in circulating insulin levels and/or
			changes in intra&#45;ovarian androgen production, on egg development within
			the patient.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;b&gt;Perimenopause: Improving Our Understanding of Aging&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt; As the
			female population ages and spends more than one&#45;third of their lives
			post&#45;menopausal, understanding those factors which impact on the rate of
			aging and its implications for later health become increasingly
			important. Working in collaboration with Dr. Renee Reijo, from the CRS,
			and Dr. Barbara Sternfeld, epidemiologist at Kaiser Department of
			Research, we propose a population&#45;based study of reproductive aging.
			This study will develop new clinical markers of ovarian aging and
			correlate these markers with specific genes and interacting proteins
			that appear to be important in oocyte development and survival. A
			longitudinal component of this study will follow the cohort
			prospectively to better understand reproductive aging and the impact of
			environmental factors. 
			
			&lt;p&gt;Women who continue to maintain regular menses, as
			they enter the fifth decade, begin to report increasing physical and
			psychological changes. Preceding the onset of these changes is a decline
			in growth hormone (GH) levels and activity (somatopause). Many
			alterations in function and structure, such as changes in muscle mass,
			adipose tissue and bone density, which occur with aging, may be linked
			to this relative deficiency of GH. We hypothesize that changes in the GH
			axis also lead to abnormalities in hypothalamic&#45;pituitary function and a
			subsequent decline in ovulatory and psychological functioning. Our
			secondary hypothesis is that re&#45;establishment of normal GH activity will
			correct abnormal hypothalamic&#45;pituitary function leading to partial, or
			complete normalization of ovarian function and improvement in
			psychological symptomatology. One would not expect alterations in GH to
			restore complete ovarian function once the oocyte pool has been
			depleted. However, a better understanding of the acceleration of oocyte
			depletion seen in the late 30's might improve fertility outcome and
			adverse effects of aging in women in a more natural way. The goal of
			therapy in this group of women is to enhance longevity and quality of
			life. This requires a complete understanding of the changing endocrine
			milieu, those changes which increase risk for symptomatology, and the
			effects of available treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;b&gt; Research Activities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			Our current research is focused on the signal transduction, molecular properties, and biological roles of the extracellular calcium&#45;sensing receptors (CaSR). Specifically, we are investigating how cells detect changes in the extracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]e) and then respond with changes in cell function in a variety of systems, including parathyroid cells (PTCs), growth plate chondrocytes (GPCs), bone cells, and neurons. To achieve these research goals, we have developed a floxed&#45;CaSR mouse line that allows for tissue&#45;specific KO of the Casr gene to definitively assess CaSR function in vivo and in vitro cell culture models to study underlying mechanism(s) mediated by this receptor.&lt;/p&gt;
			We generated mice with PTC&#45;specific CaSR KO that recapitulates the hyperparathyroidism (HPT) phenotype seen in diseases familial benign hypocalciuria and hypercalcemia (FBHH) and neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism (NSHPT). This KO mouse is the first HPT model solely caused by defective Ca2+&#45;sensing in PTCs. We are now using these mice with other gene KO models to further investigate interplays of the CaR with vitamin D receptor (VDR), insulin&#45;like growth factor&#45;1 receptor (IGF1R) and other growth factors in parathyroid functions in vivo and in vitro. &lt;/p&gt;
			Ionized Ca2+ and the CaSR play an important role in modulating the pace of GPC and bone cell differentiation in culture. Specifically, low [Ca2+]e delays and high [Ca2+]e accelerates the expression of differentiation marker genes and the mineralization of an extracellular matrix. We further confirmed the role of the CaSR in the development of growth plate cartilage and bone in vivo by studying skeletal phenotypes of chondrocyte&#45; and osteoblast&#45;specific CaSR KO mice. These mice developed rickets or osteomalacia due to delayed differentiation and increased apoptosis of chondrocyte and osteoblast in cartilage and bone, respectively. We are now investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of CaR on the chondrocyte and bone cell differentiation focusing on Wnt and IGF1 signaling pathways.  &lt;/p&gt;
			We have shown that the CaSR can form heterodimers with the type B ?&#45;amino butyric acid (GABA) receptor subtype 1 and 2 (GABA&#45;B&#45;R1 and R2) and that co&#45;expressing GABA&#45;B&#45;R1 profoundly blocks the expression of the CaSR in transfected HEK&#45;293 cells, potentially by increasing protein degradation. We further found that CaSR expression increases in brains of GABA&#45;B&#45;R1 KO mice and that acute inhibition of GABA&#45;B&#45;R1 expression promotes the CaSR expression in cultured neurons. In association with the up&#45;regulation of the CaSR, the cultured neurons lacking GABA&#45;B&#45;R1 were prone to become apoptotic. In mice subjected to brain&#45;specific ischemia, there is an increase in CaSR expression and numbers of apoptotic neurons along with a decrease in GABA&#45;B&#45;R1 expression in the affected brain regions. To test the hypothesis that over&#45;activity of CaSR plays a causal role in promoting neuronal death and brain injuries in mice lacking GABA&#45;B&#45;R1 expression and in mice subjected to brain ischemia and traumatic brain injury, we have generated neuron&#45;specific CaSR KO mice. In addition to testing the biological role of CaSR in brain development and function, we will use these mice to determine whether blocking CaSR expression lessens the ability of ischemia and GABA&#45;B&#45;R1 KO to induce neuronal death and seizures. &lt;/p&gt;
			Mice with neuron&#45;specific CaSR KO are growth retarded with impaired skeletal development and increased abdominal fat. In these mice, the hypothalamus is severely dysregulated, leading to panhypopituitarism and aberrant GH/IGF1, thyroid, reproduction, and energy homeostasis. Investigations are being initiated to define the function of the CaSR in sub&#45;populations of hypothalamic neurons and pituitary cells in regulating growth and energy metabolism in different mouse models.  &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;b&gt; CURRENT RESEARCH INTERESTS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
			 My research interests have been guided by a longstanding interest in genetics and developmental biology with a focus on reproductive biology.  My training in endocrinology has introduced me to the unique intersection of these interests with immunology in the study of endocrine autoimmunity.  My current research centers on investigations on autoimmune ovarian disease (AOD) by utilizing a novel mouse model of spontaneous autoimmune disease, the aire knockout mouse.  AOD is a poorly understood condition contributing to premature menopause and infertility in ~1.5 million women in the US.  The focus of my work includes: &lt;/p&gt;
			 &lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Characterization of immune&#45;mediated disease mechanisms leading to oophoritis
			&lt;li&gt;Identification of a disease&#45;specific ovarian antigen 
			&lt;li&gt;Study of mechanisms of antigen&#45;specific tolerance induction
			&lt;li&gt;Potential application of improved autoantibody screening to patients affected by premature ovarian failure
			&lt;li&gt;Translation of antigenic targets from the animal model to improve diagnostic testing and identify therapeutic targets in human ovarian failure and infertility.
			&lt;/ul&gt;
			The identification of autoantibodies and target antigens in a mouse model will allow better elucidation of the steps that lead to the breakdown of immunologic tolerance in the ovary and thus disease pathogenesis.  These targets may be shared with patients with AOD since the aire knockout mouse is a model for the known human autoimmune syndrome, APS 1.  Identification of such targets will allow for potential translation of autoantibody testing for improved diagnosis of AOD patients and experiments to induce tolerance to putative shared antigens between the human and mouse model.  My studies of endocrine autoimmunity and its effect on reproductive biology will address questions on the mechanisms of immune tolerance induction that may be shared among many different autoimmune diseases.   &lt;/p&gt;

			Our research continues to focus on the mechanisms involved in the initiation, development, growth, invasion and distant spread of thyroid cancer. Perhaps equally important are our investigations regarding methods to inhibit tumor growth, invasion and metastasis by inducing tumor re&#45;differentiation, increasing apoptosis, as well as decreasing tumor proliferation. These investigations have involved the use of retinoic acid, PPAR g agonists, histone deacetylase inhibitors, and other agents to redifferentiate the thyroid cancers, and to make them more responsive to treatment with 131&#45;I ablation therapy and perhaps also to thyroid hormone suppressive therapy. &lt;/p&gt;
			 We are now using combinations of these agents both to see if various combinations of medications will be more effective than single agents and determine what mechanisms involved in tumor growth and metastasis. We have also used these agents in combination with chemotherapy and heat shock protein inhibitors. &lt;/p&gt;
			 We have recently completed a prospective clinical investigation regarding the use of retinoic acid in patients with thyroid cancer and have initiated a prospective investigation regarding the use of rosiglitazone in a similar group of thyroid cancer patients that are thyroglobulin (Tg) positive and Tg negative. &lt;/p&gt;
			 Other investigations include basic science and clinical studies in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism and adrenal tumors. Our parathyroid studies include evaluation of the changing surgical approaches used to treat patients with hyperparathyroidism and the development of new techniques to localize parathyroid tumors. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; Many hormone signals are transmitted via members of a
			family of ~370 different G protein&#45;coupled receptors (GPCRs). These
			signals control vital physiological processes, such as the development
			of stem cells, metabolism, heart rate control, and neurotransmission. To
			better understand their role in vivo, we have three primary avenues of
			research:
			&lt;p&gt;A. New Receptors: To control signaling at the receptor level,
			we engineered GPCRs that are unresponsive to endogenous levels of
			natural hormones, but can still be activated by administration of
			synthetic small molecule drugs. When these opioid receptors, called
			RASSLs ( R eceptor A ctivated S olely by a S ynthetic L igand), are
			expressed in the heart, they activate G i signaling and dramatically
			slow heart rate. RASSLs expressed in other tissues control responses
			such as neurotransmission, taste perception, and bone formation, leading
			to new insights on how GPCRs control these vital physiological events.
			
			B. Bioinformatics and Signaling: We activated each major G protein
			signaling pathway and are using DNA microarrays to determine the
			resulting gene expression changes at a genomic scale. To analyze the
			data in the context of biological pathways, we developed a free software
			package called GenMAPP (Gene MicroArray Pathway Profiler,
			www.GenMAPP.org) that allows for rapid analysis of large amounts of gene
			expression data by mapping changes in specific genes onto known
			biochemical or signaling pathways. We are expanding the program to allow
			genome&#45;wide, pathway&#45;oriented analysis of a variety of functional
			genomic experiments. 
			
			&lt;p&gt;C. Genome engineering: We are involved in a large
			scale, academic collaboration (BayGenomics,
			http://baygenomics.ucsf.edu/) to contribute to the functional
			inactivation of all the genes in the mouse genome. BayGenomics focuses
			on random gene trapping that has inactivated over 2800 genes in mouse
			embryonic stem cells (6). 
			
			&lt;p&gt;Our research focuses on bioinformatics,
			targeting RASSLs to specific trapped loci and new trapping vectors. Our
			research focuses on understanding the physiological consequences of
			hormone signaling in mice, humans, or ES&#45;derived tissues. We combine the
			tools of molecular biology, genetics, bioinformatics, and physiology to
			answer fundamental issues in pharmacology.&lt;/p&gt;

			My research focuses on mechanisms of autoimmunity that result in destruction of pancreatic beta&#45;cells and development of insulin&#45;dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). There are three main target antigens in this process: the smaller isoform of the GABA&#45;synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase, GAD65; a tyrosine phosphatase, IA&#45;2; and a heavily glycosylated membrane protein named glima 38. Current research projects focus on four main areas: (i) structure, function, and cell biology of GAD65, IA&#45;2 and glima 38; (ii) characterization of disease&#45;specific B&#45;cell epitopes in GAD65, and IA2 and the temporal pattern of their recognition during early and late phases of beta&#45;cell destruction; (iii) characterization of autoimmune T&#45;cell epitopes in GAD65 and IA2 and how they can be used to induce apoptosis in autoimmune T&#45;cells during the preclinical phase to prevent disease; (iv) mechanisms of transplantation tolerance and development of methods to prevent allo&#45; as well as autoimmune destruction of islet cell transplants.

			&lt;b&gt;Mechanisms in Cardiovascular Biology and Disease &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; The
			coagulation protease thrombin plays a key role in hemostasis and
			thrombosis in part by triggering responses in platelets. Protease
			signaling in other cell types is likely important in inflammation,
			angiogenesis, and embryonic development. How does a protease behave like
			a hormone to activate cells? We've characterized a family of
			protease&#45;activated G protein&#45;coupled receptors (PARs) that provide an
			answer. Thrombin cleaves PAR1's amino terminal exodomain to unmask a new
			amino terminus that then serves as a tethered peptide ligand, binding
			intramolecularly to the body of the receptor to cause transmembrane
			signaling. Mammals have four PARs. PAR1, PAR3 and PAR4 can be activated
			by thrombin. PAR2 is activated by trypsin and other proteases with
			trypsin&#45;like specificity. Together with the coagulation cascade, PARs
			provide a system that links mechanical information in the form of tissue
			injury to biochemical information and cellular responses. Current work
			focuses on: 
			
			&lt;b&gt;PAR activation.&lt;/b&gt; There is strong evidence that PARs 1, 3 and
			4 mediate responses to thrombin in vivo, but it is certainly possible
			that other proteases served as physiological activators of these
			receptors. Moreover, although PAR2 can be activated by trypsin and other
			trypsin&#45;like proteases, physiological activators for PAR2 have not been
			clearly identified. We are attempting to identify novel PAR activators
			by biochemical and genomic approaches.&lt;p&gt;
			
			&lt;b&gt;PARs in physiology and disease.&lt;/b&gt;
			We have generated mice deficient in PAR1, PAR2, PAR3, or PAR4. These
			mice have allowed us to determine which PARs account for responses to
			thrombin and other proteases in platelets and other specific cell types
			and to show that PARs in platelets play a key role in hemostasis and
			thrombosis. Ongoing studies use PAR&#45;deficient mice to define the exact
			role in thrombin signaling in platelets during the formation of thrombi
			and to probe the role of PARs in inflammation and in other processes.&lt;p&gt;
			
			&lt;b&gt;Protease signaling in embryonic development.&lt;/b&gt; Approximately half of
			PAR1&#45;deficient mouse embryos die at ~E9.5, apparently from bleeding.
			Endothelial cell&#45;specific expression of a PAR1 by transgene prevented
			death of PAR1&#45;deficient embryos. Thus PAR1 signaling in endothelial
			cells, perhaps in response to coagulation proteases, is important for
			normal blood vessel development. Efforts to identify the specific
			proteases and endothelial responses involved are in progress. Other
			studies are dissecting an apparent role for PARs in the development of
			the CNS. 
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;G protein&#45;coupled receptor signaling in vivo.&lt;/b&gt; PAR1 couples to
			heterotrimeric G proteins of the Gq, Gi, and G12/13 families. We have
			generated mice in which G12/13 and Gi signaling can be disrupted in a
			cell&#45;type specific manner. We are using these mice to probe the roles of
			specific G protein signaling pathways in hemostasis and thrombosis,
			blood vessel formation, hematopoiesis and other processes.&lt;/p&gt;

			We have studied the role of the adrenocortical system on hypothalamic regulation of feeding behavior and metabolism and the role of chronic stress on brain pathways regulating adrenocortical, autonomic and behavioral responses to novel stressors. Because glucocorticoid (GC) receptors exist in every tissue type, changes in autonomic activity, energy balance and behavior that occur with either GC treatment or chronic stress may be either directly related to GC action in the tissue studied or secondary to a GC effect on another process, such as insulin secretion. We have used increased expression of the immediate early gene, c&#45;fos, to determine where in brain changes occur in response to stress and/or steroid treatment, and identify the responsive cell type using in situ hybridization. Additionally, we use tracing techniques and lesions to define the relevant pathways involved. Chronic stress appears to recruit central neural pathways that mediate both adrenocortical, autonomic and behavioral responses to acute stress and the disposition of energy so that fat is gained and muscle lost &#45; not good for health. Our lab is now closed, but my goals remain to elucidate the roles of glucocorticoids, insulin and chronic stress on regulation of function in people. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;b&gt; Protein Conformation and Human Disease&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; Effective treatment
			of many human diseases will derive from understanding and modulating
			protein interactions, modifications, and conformation changes. We use
			fluorescence&#45;based biophysical methods in conjunction with cell and
			animal models to study the cellular regulation of protein conformation
			and to identify small molecules that will modulate this process to treat
			disease. Our long&#45;term goal is to develop highly specific therapies for
			human diseases based on selective control of intra and inter&#45;molecular
			protein interactions. We are doing this for two classes of proteins:
			polyglutamine proteins, which cause neurodegenerative disease, and
			nuclear receptors, especially the androgen receptor (AR). AR is linked
			to development and progression of prostate cancer, in addition to its
			role in neurodegeneration in X&#45;linked spinobulbar muscular atrophy
			(SBMA). We have made major discoveries in each area that have opened up
			novel and fruitful ways to develop new therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;b&gt;Polyglutamine Diseases  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			
			Polyglutamine diseases constitute a family of devastating, dominantly
			inherited neurodegenerative conditions that are caused by CAG triplet
			repeat expansions within unrelated genes. CAG encodes the amino acid
			glutamine, and the affected proteins have enlarged tracts of this amino
			acid. All of the diseases show marked repeat length dependence, and, in
			most cases, if repeats exceed 37 there is virtually 100% penetrance.
			Conversely, if there are fewer than 35 repeats disease never occurs.
			This implies that a critically expanded glutamine tract is subject to a
			crucial conformational shift that leads to a misfolded protein.
			Consistent with this hypothesis, these diseases are characterized by
			insoluble intracellular inclusions comprised of the mutant proteins,
			particularly within vulnerable neurons. Huntington Disease (HD), a
			progressive neuropsychiatric condition characterized by a unique
			movement disorder, is the most common member of this family and is
			caused by repeat expansion in a protein of uncertain function,
			huntingtin (htt). SBMA is caused by repeat expansion in the androgen
			receptor (AR) and causes progressive motor neuron degeneration and
			muscle weakness. SBMA only afflicts males. Current research indicates
			that this motor neuron disease depends on the action of the male hormone
			testosterone on AR.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;b&gt;Current Projects in Polyglutamine Disease Pathogenesis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			
			&lt;b&gt;1. High&#45;throughput Approaches:&lt;/b&gt;  Our FRET&#45;based cellular assay of
			polyglutamine protein misfolding is an extremely powerful biophysical
			method to identify small molecules and cellular factors that regulate
			the formation of toxic aggregates. We have continued our initial efforts
			by screening over 4000 biologically active small molecules, and have
			characterized 10 hits that function via modulation of distinct cellular
			signaling pathways. We are now using an RNAi screening approach with our
			FRET assay to identify specific genes that regulate polyglutamine
			protein misfolding.&lt;p&gt;
			
			&lt;b&gt;2. Cell Biology :&lt;/b&gt; We have now determined that AR and htt are
			actin&#45;binding proteins and that this interaction somehow modulates their
			potential for aggregation and toxicity. We are determining motifs and
			accessory factors required for this interaction, and are investigating
			how the actin interaction influences polyglutamine disease pathogenesis.
			We are also using pharmacologic hits from our screening effort (of which
			&amp;#126;50% reduce neurodegeneration in Drosophila ) to characterize additional
			pathways that may modulate polyglutamine toxicity.&lt;p&gt;
			
			&lt;b&gt;3. Drosophila Models:&lt;/b&gt; Fruit flies are a powerful tool with which
			to study neurodegenerative disease due to their relatively short
			lifespan, complex behavior, and genetic tractability. While most of our
			studies have been performed in collaboration with the Marsh lab, we are
			now developing these techniques for use in our laboratory. We are using
			Drosophila models of polyglutamine disease to test potential therapeutic
			compounds and to investigate the role of certain genes predicted to be
			important from cell biological studies.&lt;p&gt;
			
			&lt;b&gt;4. Mouse Models:&lt;/b&gt; Mouse models are the primary system with which
			to study polyglutamine pathology in mammals. They are crucial to
			understanding the potential significance of any finding for humans. We
			are using behavioral, pathological, and biochemical studies in mouse
			models of HD and SBMA to test the therapeutic value of the compound
			Y&#45;27632. This work has significant implications for developing Y&#45;27632
			as a potential human treatment and for testing the importance of the
			p160ROCK pathway in regulating polyglutamine toxicity.&lt;p&gt;
			
			&lt;b&gt;The Androgen Receptor and Prostate Cancer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			
			Nuclear receptors function by binding cognate ligands, which causes them
			to undergo conformational changes (intra and intermolecular), and
			modulate the expression of specific genes. This occurs in the context of
			complex interactions with chaperones and co&#45;regulatory molecules. In
			addition to its role in causing androgen&#45;dependent neurodegeneration in
			SBMA, the AR is also the primary therapeutic target for prostate cancer,
			a leading cause of cancer death in males. Our laboratory is interested
			in the modulation of AR interactions as a potential therapeutic
			intervention for prostate cancer and SBMA. We have used our experience
			in studying the pathophysiology of AR function in SBMA to identify novel
			AR inhibitors that may be useful for treating patients with prostate
			cancer.&lt;p&gt;
			
			&lt;b&gt;Actin and Normal AR Function&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			
			Our prior work has indicated that AR is an actin&#45;binding protein and
			that this interaction appears to regulate AR activity. We are now
			investigating the role of signaling pathways that influence actin with
			regard to their control of multiple aspects of AR function:
			ligand&#45;induced intramolecular conformational change, dimerization,
			nuclear localization, and transcriptional regulation. We anticipate that
			this will lead to novel therapies, particularly for patients with
			advanced prostate cancer, in whom conventional AR antagonists are
			ineffective. The development of a high&#45;throughput system to detect AR
			conformation changes has allowed us to initiate chemical and genetic
			screens to identify small molecules that directly (via interaction with
			AR) or indirectly (via modulation of cell signaling pathways) modulate
			AR conformation. Such approaches could be important in developing new
			therapies for prostate cancer.&lt;p&gt;

			Research in my laboratory is focused on the role of the liver in maintaining whole body homeostasis. We are especially interested in the regulation of cholesterol, lipoprotein and biliary metabolism. We have two major ongoing projects.
			&lt;p&gt; 
			The first project is targeted at defining mechanisms of integrated regulation of the cholesterol, fatty acid, bile acid and carbohydrate metabolic pathways using gene knockout mouse models. Our approach is to determine the effects of specific gene knockout of key genes in the cholesterol and bile acid metabolic pathways. We study these at the physiologic, cell biology, biochemical and molecular levels. We also investigate interaction of these genes with gender, diet, aging and genetic background. At present, we are studying the effects of knocking out two genes that encode enzymes responsible for catalyzing the initial steps of cholesterol catabolism and bile acid synthesis in the liver. These genes are members of the large CYP family of genes. The first, CYP7A, encodes a protein with cholesterol 7 a &#45;hydroxylase activity and is expressed under normal conditions only in hepatocytes. Genetic CYP7A deficiency in humans results in hypercholesterolemia. The second, CYP27A, encodes a protein with sterol 27&#45;hydroxylase activity and is expressed in many different tissues and cell types. Genetic CYP27A deficiency in humans results in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). We are studying the effects of single and double gene knockouts in mice.
			&lt;p&gt;
			The second project is focused on studying the etiology(s), progression and genetics of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This disease is rapidly increasing in the human population and has become a public health problem world&#45;wide. Little is understood about its causes or its progression. We recently have developed a diet&#45;induced mouse model of NAFLD that closely mimics the whole range of this disease in humans. Studies with this model include: longitudinal characterization of the progression of disease at the morphological, biochemical and molecular levels and identification of genes involved in NAFLD and its progression using classic mouse genetics and quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses.

			Our research focuses on understanding lipid synthesis and energy metabolism in cells and organisms. Work in the laboratory falls into three major categories. The first is aimed at understanding the pathways and enzymes involved in neutral lipid synthesis and how they function in physiology and disease in whole organisms. Specifically, we study genes that encode enzymes in triglyceride and cholesterol ester biosynthesis and how they function in lipid metabolism in physiology and diseases such as atherosclerosis, obesity, and diabetes. Second, we study how these enzymes function in the storage of lipids in cells and how they contribute to lipid droplet formation. Finally, we are interested in processes that regulate energy expenditure in animals, with a particular emphasis on hormones and processes that regulate cellular fat storage and oxidation.&lt;/p&gt; 
			
			The accumulation of lipids in tissues plays a central role in diseases that are major worldwide health concerns. For example, triglyceride accumulation in adipose tissue gives rise to obesity. In addition, triglyceride deposition in other tissues is associated with the development of diseases such as diabetes, steatohepatitis, and cardiomyopathy. We are studying the pathways and enzymes that synthesize these lipids to understand the basic mechanisms and determine their role in disease. Our research has identified several potential targets for new therapies. &lt;p&gt;
			
			We use a variety of approaches, including cell culture models and genetically modified mice. Our work spans multiple research disciplines, from molecular biology to lipid biochemistry to whole organism physiology. Ultimately, we are interested in both the fundamental biology of lipid metabolism at the molecular level and how this basic research relates to physiology and disease. &lt;p&gt;
			
			We have identified and cloned many of the genes that encode important enzymes in neutral lipid synthesis, and we have elucidated the functions of these enzymes in physiology and disease. For example, we defined the functional roles of acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) enzymes in systemic cholesterol metabolism and atherosclerosis. We also identified the mammalian acyl CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) genes and elucidated their roles in mammalian triglyceride and energy metabolism. &lt;p&gt;

			&lt;b&gt;Endocrinology of Placenta Formation and Pregnancy &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
			 We are studying the mechanisms by which human trophoblast cells invade the uterus during normal pregnancy. Human fetal development depends on the embryo's ability to rapidly gain access to the maternal circulation. The cytotrophoblasts that form the fetal portion of the human placenta have solved this problem by transiently exhibiting certain invasive, tumor&#45;like properties.&lt;p&gt;
			
			We have been particularly interested in the role of proteinases and adhesion molecules in mediating cytotrophoblast invasion. In these studies, we have used two approaches. One approach is immunolocalization of relevant molecules in biopsy specimens of the maternal&#45;fetal interface. Here, polarized chorionic villus cytotrophoblasts form multilayered columns of nonpolarized cells that leave the fetal compartment and invade the uterus. The other approach is an in vitro model we developed that supports cytotrophoblast differentiation along the invasive pathway. We have used this model to test the function of molecules we suspect play a role in invasion. &lt;p&gt;
			Immunolocalization studies show that in normal pregnancy, cytotrophoblast invasion, both in vivo and in vitro, is accompanied by a dramatic switch cellular expression of matrix&#45;degrading metalloproteinases and adhesion molecules. Function&#45;perturbation experiments suggest that cytotrophoblasts carefully regulate their invasive potential by simultaneously expressing a number of molecules that either promote or inhibit invasion. Most recently, we found that cytotrophoblasts that replace the endothelial lining of uterine blood vessels also have the amazing ability to mimic the adhesion phenotype of vascular cells. This phenomenon is likely to be a critical component of normal placentation. What controls this highly unusual differentiation process? Since cytotrophoblasts target large&#45;bore arterioles for invasion, we reasoned that oxygen tension could play a role. Recently, we showed that oxygen controls whether cells proliferate or exit the cell cycle and differentiate. &lt;p&gt;
			We are also investigating why cytotrophoblast invasion is abnormally shallow in preeclampsia, a serious complication of pregnancy characterized by high blood pressure, proteinuria, and intrauterine growth retardation. We hypothesized that this syndrome could be associated with a defect in cytotrophoblast differentiation along the invasive pathway. We have now shown that this is the case. In preeclampsia, the cells start to differentiate, but do not complete the process. This has two important consequences. First, cytotrophoblasts fail to express antigens that are critical for invasion. This observation helps explain why shallow placentation is consistently observed in this syndrome. Second, they fail to mimic a vascular adhesion phenotype. We are very interested in how this failure could be related to the maternal vascular disease. &lt;p&gt;
			Additionally, we are intrigued by the immune paradox of pregnancy&#45;the only normal situation in which the host tolerates genetically foreign cells. The methods we developed to study trophoblast invasion have allowed us to ask basic questions about cytotrophoblast expression of molecules that could allow the fetus to avoid rejection. We discovered that invasive cells express a very unusual major histocompatibility antigen, HLA&#45;G, that could play an important role in governing the maternal immune response. Recently we also showed that cytotrophoblasts produce large amounts of IL&#45;10, an immunoinhibitory cytokine, as well as chemokines, which regulate maternal immune cell trafficking. &lt;p&gt;
			In parallel, our lab has begun studying the earliest stages of human development using human embryonic stem cells as a model system. Our work to date has focused on deriving additional lines using feeders formed from human placental cells. Additionally, we recently made the surprising discovery that the cells are polarized. Currently, we are investigating how this highly specialized phenomenon is related to pluripotency. &lt;p&gt;

			&lt;b&gt;Hormonal Regulation of Growth and Hypertrophy in the Cardiovascular and Renal Systems  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
			  Our laboratory is interested in defining the molecular determinants that govern expression of the natriuretic peptide genes in myocardial cells and the genes encoding their receptors in vascular and renal cells. Two natriuretic peptide hormones are produced in the heart. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is preferentially expressed in the atrial vs. ventricular myocytes of the neonatal rat heart while brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is expressed predominantly in the cardiac ventricle. Each of these genes is typically expressed at a very low level in adult ventricular myocardium; however, under conditions which promote hypertrophy of the heart (e.g. high blood pressure or congestive heart failure), ventricular expression of both genes increases dramatically. Using a variety of biochemical and mechanical stimuli to induce hypertrophy in cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes, we are attempting to define the molecular mechanisms which link the hypertrophic stimulus to enhanced expression of these marker genes. We hope to use this information to develop strategies for uncoupling the mechanism and controlling the hypertrophic response.&lt;p&gt;
			  Receptors for the NPs can be divided into two major classes. The first, which includes natriuretic peptide receptors (NPR) A and B, possesses particulate guanylyl cyclase activity. These receptors are believed to mediate most of the biologically important effects of the peptides. The second category includes NPR&#45;C, a single transmembrane domain receptor with a truncated intracellular domain. This receptor seems to operate in a clearance mode in vivo, although there is growing evidence that it also possesses signaling activity. We are in the process of identifying the molecular determinants that govern transcriptional activity of the promoters linked to each of these three genes. Both NPR&#45;A and B, and possibly NPR&#45;C, possess growth suppressant activity in cardiac fibroblasts and in vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells. A better understanding of these growth suppressant properties may provide important insights into the pathophysiology of disorders affecting the vascular wall or myocardial interstitium. &lt;p&gt;

			 The central focus of our laboratory is beta&#45;cell genesis, differentiation, and gene expression. Translational interests of our group are directed towards understanding where these processes break down in type 2 diabetes, and how to translate our knowledge of beta&#45;cell genesis into novel strategies for curing diabetes (type 1 and 2). The general strategy is to identify the transcription factors that regulate gene expression in progenitors and mature beta&#45;cells. These factors and their genes are then used as tools to understand the process of beta&#45;cell development by studying both how they regulate gene expression and development and how they are regulated themselves, both in mouse models and in vitro . Several lines of investigation are being pursued. &lt;/p&gt;
			 Beta&#45;cell determination and differentiation: Early in pancreatic development, many of the pancreatic and islet transcription factors are uniformly expressed in the pancreatic epithelium, demonstrating that these early cells have multiple potential fates. The mechanisms by which the expression of these factors and the potential to become beta&#45;cells becomes restricted control the differentiation of the beta&#45;cells from their neighbors. Using transgenic and gene knockout mice and in vitro differentiation assays, my lab is beginning to outline the hierarchy of these factors during beta&#45;cell development and to identify their individual roles in beta&#45;cell formation and differentiation. &lt;/p&gt;
			 Beta&#45;cell gene expression: A long&#45;term interest of our lab has been the mechanism by which the transcription of certain genes (most notably the insulin gene) is restricted to the beta&#45;cells and how that expression is regulated by nutrient cues, such as glucose concentration. Unlike differentiation, which involves a cascade of gene expression events, the differentiated state is maintained by a network of interacting factors. Ongoing studies are examining the interactions of transcription factors involved in beta&#45;cell differentiation and maintenance and the transcriptional response to glucose. &lt;/p&gt;
			 Beta&#45;cell replacement: We have begun applying the accumulating knowledge of beta&#45;cell genesis to the development of novel strategies for curing diabetes. Ultimately, a cure for people with type 1 diabetes, as well as many people with type 2 diabetes, requires the replacement of the beta&#45;cell. The genes that control beta&#45;cell development can drive the formation of beta&#45;cells from undifferentiated progenitor cells or stem cells. We are generating methods using these genes to produce new beta&#45;cells both in vitro and in vivo. &lt;/p&gt;
			 Type 2 diabetes: Type 2 diabetes results from increased insulin demand due to insulin resistance in a setting of limited insulin supply caused by beta&#45;cell dysfunction. With age, increasing adiposity and a sedentary lifestyle together contribute to insulin resistance, while at the same time beta&#45;cell function progressively declines. We have been exploring the role of genes controlling beta&#45;cell growth and replacement in determining the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. To date, most of the genes linked to type 2 diabetes in humans regulate beta&#45;cell development or function, including several genes encoding beta&#45;cell transcription factors.  &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			I am involved in clinical research projects related to pediatric diabetes. Some recent and on&#45;going projects are described below. &lt;/p&gt;
			Prevention of type 1 diabetes: I served as the Site Director for the Diabetes Prevention Trial&#45;Type 1 (DPT&#45;1), a multicenter NIH&#45;sponsored trial in which oral or parenteral insulin was used in an attempt to delay or prevent type 1 diabetes in high&#45;risk individuals. The NIH has since expanded this line of research to TrialNet, a multi&#45;center research consortium that devises trials to delay or prevent the onset of type 1 diabetes in those at risk, or to prolong endogenous insulin secretion (the honeymoon phase) in those with new&#45;onset disease. UCSF was selected as one of 14 national centers for this study, and I serve as the Principal Investigator and Clinical Director at this institution. In addition, I have collaborated with Drs.Bluestone, Masharani (UCSF) and Herold (Columbia) in evaluating the role of an anti&#45;CD3 monoclonal antibody in prolonging the honeymoon phase in those with new onset type 1 diabetes. Our initial results from a phase 1 / 2 study were published in the N Engl J Med . We are continuing to follow these patients over time, and have launched a phase 2 study for new onset diabetes, evaluating the efficacy of antibody treatment with 2 courses, at 12 month intervals. We are also planning additional studies to evaluate the window of opportunity for such therapy, with a trial planned from 6 weeks out to 6 months from diagnosis, and the use of anti&#45;CD3 plus exenatide, a glucagon&#45;like peptide&#45;1 agonist. In addition, I am principal investigator on a new multicenter trial to study the safety and efficacy of anti&#45;thymocyte globulin on preserving beta cell function in new onset type 1 diabetes (sponsored by Immune Tolerance Network, NIAID). &lt;/p&gt;
			Improving metabolic control for Latino children with type 1 diabetes: Patients from minority groups with diabetes have poorer metabolic control and are at higher risk for long&#45;term complications and death. We have decided to focus on improving diabetes care for the Latino population, as they represent the fastest growing minority group in the USA, and currently constitute the second largest ethnicity in the country. We recently completed a study on the effect of group interventions on metabolic outcomes and diabetes education in this population. We are now initiating a study to determine the effects of bilingual / bicultural nurses as case managers for Latino families. We are also evaluating the effect of a glucometer with telephonic modem connection for this population, with the goal to increase data transmission and communication with the diabetes team . &lt;/p&gt;
			Insulin pump therapy in children with type 1 diabetes : We have an on&#45;going evaluation of ~140 children now managed on the insulin pump, characterizing both metabolic outcomes and perceived changes in quality of life. In addition, we have completed a prospective randomized study of toddlers with type 1 diabetes, comparing multiple dose insulin injection therapy versus insulin pump. &lt;/p&gt;
			Development of diabetes following pediatric renal transplantation: We have an on&#45;going cohort that is followed in conjunction with our pediatric nephrology group. We are evaluating the effect of various parameters on risk for post&#45;transplant diabetes, including the choice of immunosuppressants. &lt;/p&gt;
			Type 2 diabetes in pediatrics : This type of diabetes has been exploding in the pediatric population, commensurate with the increase in obesity and more sedentary lifestyle. In conjunction with Dr. Christian Vaisse, we have been developing a cohort to evaluate clinical phenotype and underlying genotype of children with obesity and type 2 diabetes. Also, I am site director for a study sponsored by the Glaser Foundation to determine the effect of metformin and/or lifestyle interventions on obese children with insulin resistance.
			 &lt;/p&gt;
			 In addition, one area of new investigation for me is characterization of the nephrogenic syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis. The pediatric endocrine group at UCSF was the first to describe this novel condition, in which activating mutations of the vasopressin type 2 receptor result in a clinical phenotype resembling the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. In subsequent studies, we are evaluating additional patients; determining the natural course of the disease; evaluating therapeutic options; and exploring the effects of receptor mutations on trafficking and intracellular signaling. &lt;/p&gt;

			My research interests concern the signaling mechanisms for insulin and insulin&#45;related receptors and the role of these receptors in human diseases. One area of interest has been the regulation of the insulin receptor gene. We are investigating the nature of a unique nuclear binding protein for the insulin receptor gene that increases during differentiation. This protein binds to an AT rich tract in the insulin receptor promoter. A second area of research has been the purification of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors from fibroblasts of insulin&#45;resistant patients. We have found an unusual plasma membrane protein, PC&#45;1, which is present both in very insulin&#45;resistant patients and in more routine patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. PC&#45;1 blocks the ability of insulin to activate its receptor. A third area of our work is in the elucidation of the intracellular signaling mechanisms induced by oxidative stress that cause insulin resistance. We have data indicating that the potent antioxidant alpha lipoic acid can prevent the effects of oxidative stress. A fourth area is the role of the insulin receptor in the biology of breast and other cancers. We find that insulin receptors, especially the fetal insulin receptor, are over&#45;expressed in both human breast cancers and animal models of breast cancer, suggesting that this receptor may control cancer growth. &lt;/p&gt;

			My primary research interest is in mammalian cell senescence and human aging with a focus on bone and age&#45;related osteoporosis. We study the aging process in mouse and human bone cells and how aging affects bone cell function. It is thought that the loss of bone with aging is a consequence, in part, of functional and proliferative senescence of osteoblasts and osteoclast stem cell populations in the marrow. Bone marrow provides a source of osteoblast and osteoclast progenitors for the study of bone cell recruitment, maturation and function. We harvest marrow from animals and humans of different ages and selectively grow relatively pure populations of osteoblasts (OBs) and osteoclasts (OCs). As a function of donor age, the processes of osteoprogenitor recruitment and cell differentiation in vitro change. The phenotype of the bone cell gradually changes or &quot;drifts&quot; with advancing age of the donor. Coupling between bone formation and resorption is disrupted as a consequence of osteoblast up&#45;regulation of RANKL expression and down&#45;regulation of expression of the naturally opposing factor, osteoprotegerin (OPG). To correct this imbalance and reverse or prevent bone loss, clinical trials are now testing the efficacy of OPG administration. This should lead to the development of the most effective, most rational therapeutic agent for age&#45;related bone loss to date. &lt;/p&gt;

			My laboratory uses cell, molecular, and developmental biology tools to decipher the mechanisms that underlie normal mammalian pancreas formation and pancreatic diseases, including diabetes and pancreatic cancer. In particular, we are focusing on the role of embryonic signaling pathways, including Hedgehog and Wnt signaling, during pancreas formation and function. We are using state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art tools, including transgenic mice and small chemical compounds, to manipulate the activity of these pathways during pancreas formation and in mature tissue. The goal of these studies is to determine whether controlled activation and de&#45;activation of embryonic signaling pathways permits (a) the initiation of the formation of insulin&#45;producing &amp;szlig;&#45;cells from uncommitted stem cells, (e.g., embryonic and adult stem cells), and (b)  prevention of the formation and growth of pancreatic tumors.  &lt;/p&gt;
			Pancreas development: We employ knockout and transgenic mouse lines to study the effects of known signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration on pancreas morphogenesis and function. In particular, we are interested in understanding how components of the Hedgehog and Wnt signaling pathways influence endocrine cell differentiation and maintenance of organ properties in adult organisms. Our previous studies have shown that ectopic activation of Hedgehog signaling in pancreatic tissue blocks organ formation. Using the Cre&#45;loxP technology, we are currently eliminating Hedgehog signaling from pancreatic epithelium to determine whether low&#45;level Hedgehog signaling is required for some aspects of pancreas formation and islet function. In addition, using the same Cre&#45;loxP technology, we are exploring the interactions between Hedgehog and Wnt signaling, another pathway known to regulate cell differentiation in other organs. Preliminary results indicate synergistic activities of these pathways. We are currently exploring these interactions in detail and anticipate that these studies will provide important information to optimize differentiation protocols to generate insulin&#45;producing cells from progenitor cells. &lt;/p&gt;
			Diabetes and regeneration of &amp;szlig;&#45;cells: In collaboration with Dr. Gerard Evan, we have started to analyze &amp;szlig;&#45;cell regeneration in pIns&#45;cMycER TAM transgenic mice that express cMyc, a transcription factor known to cause apoptosis, in insulin&#45;producing &amp;szlig;&#45;cells. Upon transgene activation with tamoxifen, &amp;szlig;&#45;cells die, and transgenic mice become hyperglycemic. Interestingly, insulin&#45;producing cells reappear within days after termination of tamoxifen treatment, and mice eventually regain normoglycemia. Thus, these insulin promoter&#45;cMyc transgenic mice present a novel model system to study &amp;szlig;&#45;cell regeneration in mice. A detailed understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms may allow us to devise strategies to increase &amp;szlig;&#45;cell mass and the number of available islets for transplantation in diabetic patients. &lt;/p&gt;
			Model systems for pancreatic cancer: Overt hedgehog signaling has been implicated in cancer formation in various tissues, however, it had not previously been linked to the formation of pancreatic adenocarcinomas, an aggressive form of cancer that is virtually incurable. In collaboration with Martin McMahon's laboratory at the UCSF Cancer Center, we have demonstrated that deregulated Hedgehog signaling can promote proliferation of pancreatic cancer cell lines and that inhibition of Hedgehog signaling blocks cell proliferation. Currently, we are generating transgenic animals that ectopically express Hedgehog signaling molecules in pancreatic tissue to address their tumorigenic activity in vivo . Furthermore, our work describes interactions between Hedgehog and Wnt signaling in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Using small chemical compounds, we were able to demonstrate that simultaneous inhibition of both pathways has a more pronounced effect on killing pancreatic cancer cells. These studies may allow us to devise more effective methods to combat this deadly disease.  &lt;/p&gt;

			 Who studies metabolic regulation these days &#45; the flow of metabolites through competing pathways in complex networks, the anabolic and catabolic processes that determine tissue composition, adaptations to stresses and how their failure leads to disease? Not most Biochemistry or Molecular Biology Departments. It is our belief that the study of physiologic chemistry (metabolic regulation) in the broadest sense can be seized by metabolism, endocrinology and nutrition researchers interested in making fundamental contributions to biochemistry and medicine. &lt;/p&gt;
			 Toward this end, our laboratory has focused on measuring metabolic processes not previously accessible to study in vivo, particularly in humans. Our goal is to answer questions concerning regulation of molecular fluxes through complex pathways in living systems and, ultimately, to apply the techniques in humans in the setting of disease and therapeutics. Much effort is spent on methods development. For example, we have developed a stable isotope&#45;mass spectrometric method that resolves the fundamental problem in measuring polymerization biosynthesis &#45; the endogenous synthesis of biomolecules such as fatty acids, cholesterol, glucose and proteins. This technique is called mass isotopomer distribution analysis (MIDA). It has been used to ask basic questions in metabolic physiology (e.g.,do humans convert excess carbohydrate calories to fat? where does blood glucose come from during normal fasting? is this different in diabetes?). We also have developed a very accurate and non&#45;toxic method for measuring rates of cell proliferation (mitogenesis), by labeling the deoxyribose moiety of DNA with heavy water. Many questions have been answered by use of this technique: for example, how rapidly are new cells made in pancreatic islets in insulin&#45;resistant states or in the brain (hippocampus) in response to trophic factors? What is the effect of HIV infection on turnover of T&#45;lymphocytes? Does the rate of tumor cell proliferation in CLL predict clinical aggressiveness of disease? Other techniques of central interest in metabolic disorders have also been developed in our laboratory &#45; e.g., an assay of insulin resistance and pancreatic compensation, a direct measurement of reverse cholesterol transport and a measure of mitochondrial biogenesis in response to exercise. &lt;/p&gt;
			 Accordingly, our group is involved in a number of projects. These include studies of obesity/diabetes and dyslipidemias; protein metabolism and body composition, neurobiology, oncology and immunology. Translation of new kinetic techniques to humans to investigate processes responsible for health and disease is the unifying theme. &lt;/p&gt;

			Our research focuses on genetic epidemiological studies of complex phenotypes, in particular aging&#45; and metabolism&#45;related traits in humans. Through the use of extended families and large cohorts of unrelated individuals, the goal of our research is to identify susceptibility genes, environmental risk factors, and their patterns of interaction for traits of interest. We employ epidemiological principles, statistical tools and bioinformatics to perform linkage analysis and genetic association studies. Study populations include extended families from the Old Order Amish and large cohorts from the US and Mexico with extensive information from prospective long&#45;term longitudinal follow&#45;ups or national surveys. &lt;/p&gt;
			Current projects and collaborations include the following: &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Genetic epidemiology of diurnal preference and its relationship with aging &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;li&gt; Genetic epidemiology of telomere length and its relationship with aging &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;li&gt; Candidate gene studies of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and longevity &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;
			The hope is that findings from these studies will contribute to a better understanding of the disease etiology. Furthermore, they may have significant implications for disease treatment and prevention strategies, such as identifying populations at high risk and providing &quot;tailored&quot; preventive or therapeutic strategies to patients with specific genetic profiles. &lt;/p&gt;

			Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA), 1985&#45;2008: I have served as Chairman of the Steering Committee of this NHLBI&#45;funded study since its inception. This is a cohort study that follows young adults into middle age to discover the antecedent coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors, such as hypertension and obesity, and to explore genetic&#45;environmental interactions in the development of coronary artery calcium assessed by computed tomography. The 5115 participants, with roughly equal numbers of African&#45;Americans and Caucasians, of men and women, and of lower and higher educated people, have been followed for 19 years in clinical centers in Oakland, Birmingham, Minneapolis, and Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;
			Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study (HERS), 1992&#45;2005: I am the Principal Investigator of the Coordinating Center for this study with 20 collaborating Clinical Centers. This randomized clinical trial examines the effects of estrogen plus progestin therapy on the recurrence of CHD events in postmenopausal women with coronary disease, as well as on other disease outcomes such as thromboembolism, cognitive function and quality of life. In addition to continuing to report findings from the main trial (which ended in 2002), we have two ongoing ancillary projects: (1) to study thrombosis gene polymorphisms, and (2) to examine the relationship between estrogen receptor polymorphisms and the effect of hormone therapy on HDL and other outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;
			Medicine or Surgery (Ms), 1996&#45;2005: I am the Principal Investigator of this 4&#45;center randomized clinical trial and Principal Investigator of its coordinating center. The study included two randomized trials, one comparing the impact on quality of life of hysterectomy vs medical management for abnormal uterine bleeding in pre&#45;menopausal women, and the other comparing supracervical vs total abdominal hysterectomy. &lt;/p&gt;
			Pharmacogenetics and Risk of Cardiovascular disease (PARC), 2001&#45;5: I am the Principal Investigator of the Coordinating Center of this NIH&#45;funded study headed by Dr. Ron Kraus. The goal of this study is to identify common gene variants that contribute to inter&#45;individual differences in LDL&#45;cholesterol response to statins and in 24&#45;hour blood pressure response to ACE inhibitors.  &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;b&gt;Mechanisms and Impact of Environmental Factors on Neuroendocrine Development and Function &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			Our current biological interest lies in the development of a neuroendocrine center, the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), which functions as a central relay station to control both metabolic homeostasis and reproductive behavior.  Because the hypothalamus remains poorly defined at a molecular level, we used gene profiling to identify novel genes that mark subsets of neurons within this brain region (Kurrasch et al.2007). Presumably these markers participate in VMH development and function  the importance of these candidate genes is now being tested using standard molecular biology and mouse genetics.  In addition with H. Baier's lab at UCSF we used a forward genetic screen in zebrafish and found 5 mutants disrupted in early hypothalamic patterning (Kurrasch et al., 2009).  We are now asking how environmental factors influence the development and formation of the VMH.  Indeed we recently showed that the widely used herbicide atrazine activates endocrine gene networks.  This study was published in PloS One (Suzawa and Ingraham, 2008).  Our paper was discussed on Talk of the Nation NPRs Science Friday &#45; May 9th, 2008 and selected by the Faculty 1000 of Biology as a Must Read paper. &lt;/p&gt;
			We also study how a group of nuclear hormone receptors are activated, in particular members of the NR5A subfamily.  NR5A receptors are critical for development and function of the endocrine system.  In the last several years our lab used a structural approach to show that phospholipids can serve as ligands for NR5A1 nuclear receptors, such as SF&#45;1 or LRH&#45;1.  We are now determining how these phospholipids ligands affect receptor activity.  As with many transcriptional regulators, NR5A receptors are also richly modified by posttranslational events including phosphorylation and sumoylation.  We believe that NR5A receptors represent an ideal model system for investigating how sumoylation alters gene expression.  Using both biochemical and mouse genetics we are finding that sumoylation represents an important modification for directing cell specification during development.  Our recent work by Campbell et al. 2008 suggests that some target genes will be sumo&#45;sensitive while others will be much less sensitive.  This hypothesis is being tested in an in vivo mouse model system.

			My current research is primarily in two areas: (1) angiogenesis and ovarian cancer, and (2) regulation of growth and function of the primate fetal adrenal gland. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			In the area of angiogenesis in ovarian cancer, we developed a nude mouse model of advanced human ovarian cancer with ascites. Using this model, we studied a variety of regimens to inhibit angiogenesis, thereby preventing tumor growth. These have included inhibition of phosphatidylinositol&#45;3&#45;kinase (PI3&#45;K), a molecule involved in the signaling of a key angiogenic molecule, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). We have used this PI3&#45;K inhibitor in the presence and absence of the chemotherapeutic agent, paclitaxel, and found marked inhibition of ascites and an ~ 80% reduction in tumor burden. We also have used two inhibitors of VEGF itself, a VEGF monoclonal antibody and a VEGF soluble decoy receptor, the VEGF Trap, again, both in the presence and absence of paclitaxel. Both agents had a marked effect on reduction of ascites and tumor burden when used in combination of paclitaxel, with the VEGF Trap + paclitaxel achieving a striking 98% reduction in tumor burden and virtually complete inhibition of tumor burden. We are currently working on a clinical trial of this combination therapy. &lt;/p&gt;
			In the fetal adrenal gland, we have identified several growth factors and other peptides that have specific localizations in the different zones of the gland. These have included neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), midkine, NovH, SPARC, the low density lipoprotein receptor and others. To obtain the separation of the zones, we have used subtraction hybridization, laser capture microdissection and fluorescent activated cell sorting. To identifiy the genes that encode these proteins, we have used in situ hybridization, northern blotting and other conventional molecular biological techniques. To identify and localize the proteins, we have used immunocytochemistry, western blotting and other techniques. We have been studying the function of these molecules, particularly in regard to cell motility, growth, functional zonation and angiogenesis. We have made a detailed study of the angiogenic factors involved in the extensively vascular fetal adrenal gland essential both for secretion of steroid and catecholaminergic hormones and the ingress of trophic hormones that stimulate steroidogenesis, and we have found that ACTH stimulates both steroidogenesis and angiogenesis in a coordinated fashion. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;b&gt;Translational Research in Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			My research is focused in the fields of type 2 diabetes and obesity, specifically in understanding their complex interrelationship and whether certain biomarkers and characteristics of overweight people can predict those at greatest risk of developing diabetes.  I began this research during my fellowship by exploring the role of overall body fat (measured by body mass index) and regional body fat (measured by waist circumference) and incident cardiovascular disease and mortality among postmenopausal women. I collaborated with colleagues who were investigators in the Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study to perform this secondary data analysis. We found that waist circumference was a stronger determinant of future cardiovascular mortality than BMI, but that diabetes mediated this risk. &lt;/p&gt;
			Since this time, I focused my efforts on understanding novel biomarkers secreted from adipose tissue that may be responsible for the metabolic sequelae associated with obesity. I have assayed adiponectin from frozen serum specimens from a longitudinal cohort coordinated by UCSF, the Health, Aging and Body Composition Study. I performed a series of analyses finding that abdominal visceral adiposity, when directly measured by CT scan, is significantly associated with type 2 diabetes and that adiponectin and other cytokines and peptides (collectively termed as adipocytokines) produced by adipose tissue explain this association. We have also found strong relationships with visceral adiposity and risk of developing diabetes and cardiovascular disease over 5 years of follow&#45;up with some of these biomarkers playing important mediating roles.  &lt;/p&gt;

			Our research involves two major themes: studies of the molecular speciation of HDL and its metabolism and genetic studies involving the discovery of new Mendelian disorders and of genes associated with cardiac and cerebrovascular disease. &lt;/p&gt;
			Our work on the molecular speciation of HDL has now established the existence of at least 16 discrete species, 9 of which have been published. We are characterizing them by mass spectrometry and defining their constituent proteins and lipids. This work has identified a molecular species that appears to be the quantum species in HDL metabolism, involved in the transformation of species by enzymes and transfer proteins present in blood, and the principal agonist in a newly defined metabolic cycle (the prebeta&#45;1 HDL cycle) that plays a central role in the retrieval of cholesterol from the artery wall. An extension of this work is studying the molecular basis of macular degeneration. We have demonstrated the synthesis of apolipoprotein E in retinal pigment epithelial cells and the efflux of hydroperoxidized retinal lipids to HDL species. &lt;/p&gt;
			Our genetic studies involve the discovery of new Mendelian disorders of lipid metabolism. This is based on study of DNA from a large collection that we have established in the CVRI, the Genomic Resource in Arteriosclerosis. This collection, numbering over 20,000 samples, with extensive biochemical and clinical annotation, is designed as a resource for collaborations with other UCSF investigators as well as supporting our research. We have discovered a number of Mendelian disorders including a receptor ligand defect in apo B&#45;100 that is estimated to affect over a quarter of a million individuals in the U.S. alone. Among others, we have found a novel disorder, cholesterol 7&#45;alpha hydroxylase deficiency that causes hyperlipidemia, resistance to statin drugs, arteriosclerosis and premature gallstone disease. &lt;/p&gt;
			Our genetic studies on arteriosclerosis have now yielded over 7 million genotypes in a BioStar collaboration. We have identified 21 new gene associations with myocardial infarction and 4 with stroke, to date. All associations are confirmed in 3 sequential cohorts to address the issue of multiple sampling error. In collaboration with Drs.Brad Aouizerat and Raphael Merriman, we have found 3 gene associations with familial combined hyperlipidemia and with non&#45;alcoholic hepatic steattosis. This is consistent with metabolic models generated for these two disorders and establishes a mechanistic commonality for the two syndromes. &lt;/p&gt;

			My research focuses on the evaluation of genetic events that contribute to the pathogenesis of thyroid cancer. The long&#45;term goals of these studies are to translate these findings to improve diagnostic, treatment and prognostication strategies in patients with thyroid cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;b&gt; The Role of Id Transcription Proteins in Thyroid Tumorigenesis &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			Over the past 3 years, we have begun to investigate the function of the Id proteins in thyroid tumors. We have focused on the expression and regulation of two particular Id proteins, Id1 and Id2, making use of our in&#45;vitro thyroid cancer cell line model and thyroid cancer tissue bank. We have found that Id1 protein is an important regulator of cellular proliferation and differentiation in thyroid cancers. Our current efforts are centered on understanding the function of Id1 and Id2 proteins in thyroid cancer invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis, and its potential as a therapeutic target gene in thyroid cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;b&gt; Molecular Markers of Thyroid Neoplasms  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			Our cDNA array gene profiling studies have identified 7 candidate diagnostic and prognostic markers of malignant thyroid neoplasms. Based on these studies, we have developed a multigene assay to improve the diagnosis accuracy of thyroid nodule FNA biopsy and to better predict tumor behavior. We have begun to study the clinical utility and feasibility of applying these molecular markers to thyroid nodule FNA biopsy samples and as markers of disease aggressiveness. &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;b&gt; Redifferentiation Therapy in Thyroid Cancers of Follicular Cell Origin  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			Because the expression of sodium&#45;iodide symporter is critical for effective radioiodine uptake and therefore ablation of thyroid cancer cells, we are currently studying the effects of re&#45;differentiating agents such as HDAC inhibitors in thyroid cancer cells. As a result of these studies, we have developed two clinical trials to evaluate re&#45;differentiation therapy in patients who have differentiated thyroid cancers that are unresectable and unresponsive to radioiodine therapy. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;b&gt;Molecular Coordination in T cell Signaling (TCRs) &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			T cell receptors (TCRs) undergo a coordinated series of clustering events during the onset of signaling resulting in the formation of an 'immunological synapse'. Most notably, small elementary receptor clusters are coalesced into a single cluster at the center of the T cell/antigen&#45;presenting cell interface. Coincident with this, the entire T cell undergoes a repolarization event in which TCRs are recruited along the membrane to the interface region. Our recent data suggest that myosin motors are critical for controlling polarization of the TCR toward the APC and, as such, also profoundly affect the duration and magnitude of intracellular signaling. In addition, concerted recruitment of co&#45;receptors and co&#45;stimultory molecules is involved in generating sustained signaling. Understanding the activities and mechanisms that control events of T cell activation is an outstanding issue in the field of T cell activation. &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;b&gt; Molecular Coordination in Multipartite Interactions &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			Multiple intercellular contacts give rise to the complex systems behavior of the immune system. We are extending our imaging systems in order to study interactions amongst a variety of T cell partners such as dendritic cells and macrophages. Of particular interest are the multipartite interactions in which 3 or more cells come together si multaneously or sequentially to create complex biology. Novel biological insights can be gleaned by understanding the nature of cooperative and competitive cellular interactions. In addition, we are using molecular genetics coupled with imaging to identify novel molecular players whose localization at the cell&#45;cell contact suggests participation in initiation or maintenance of the interaction. Our ultimate goal is to uncover the methods by which the immune system regulates the decision between tolerance and immunity. &lt;/p&gt;

			Estrogen and other nuclear hormones bind to their receptors, which are tethered to the promoter of target genes, and allow the receptors to stimulate gene expression by recruiting coactivator proteins. Tamoxifen and other antiestrogens also bind to the estrogen receptor but prevent coactivator recruitment. Through both genetic and structural analysis and in concert with colleagues at UCSF, USC, and the University of Chicago, we found that the coactivator proteins recognize a hydrophobic cleft on the surface of the hormone&#45;bound estrogen and thyroid hormone receptors. Three leucines of the coactivator Nuclear Receptor Box (LXXLL) project into the cleft and couple the proteins together. Tamoxifen prevents coactivator recruitment by displacing part of the estrogen receptor, Helix 12, into the hydrophobic cleft, and this blocks access of the coactivator. &lt;/p&gt;
			Estrogen receptors activate two entirely different sorts of target genes, some with classical estrogen response elements (EREs) and some with AP&#45;1/CRE elements. We found that tamoxifen mimics estrogen and stimulates the AP&#45;1/CRE regulated target genes in uterine cells, whose growth is stimulated by tamoxifen, but not in breast cancer cells, whose growth is inhibited by tamoxifen. We were the first to propose that this action of tamoxifen is responsible for its estrogen&#45;like effects on proliferation, which is now a classical concept in the field, and recently confirmed in tamoxifen&#45;resistant breast cancer cells that tamoxifen stimulates proliferation. More recently, we have shown that newer antiestrogens, such as raloxifene, which, unlike tamoxifen, do not stimulate uterine growth, are unable to activate the AP&#45;1/CRE target genes in uterine cells, an inability we traced to their ability to promote association of the estrogen receptor with co&#45;repressors. &lt;/p&gt;
			A second estrogen receptor, ER beta, has actions that oppose that of ER alpha at the AP&#45;1/CRE type of target genes, suggesting a potential for ER beta to inhibit the pro&#45;proliferative action of ER alpha. We were the first to show differential ligand activation of estrogen receptors ER alpha and ER beta at AP1 sites in which ER beta inhibits in the presence of estrogen and activates in the presence of antiestrogens. More recently, we showed that ER beta can oppose and block ER alpha's action at the cyclin D1 gene an important mediator of the pro&#45;proliferative actions of ER alpha. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;b&gt;NK Cell Receptors in Viral Immunity, Tumor Immunity, and Autoimmunity &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			Immune responses are regulated by membrane receptors that serve to activate or inhibit cell proliferation and clonal expansion, cytokine production, and cell&#45;mediated cytotoxicity.    Our lab focuses on the human and mouse activating and inhibitory receptors that are predominantly expressed by Natural Killer (NK) cells, but are also present on subsets of effector/memory T cells and some myeloid cells.  We are particularly interested in the activating NK receptors that signal by associating with two distinct signaling adapter proteins named DAP10 and DAP12. &lt;/p&gt;
			The DAP10 signaling adapter associates with the NKG2D receptor on NK cells and T cells, and DAP10 initiates signaling through the PI3&#45;kinase pathway. We have implicated the NKG2D&#45;DAP10 receptor in NK cell and T cell&#45;mediated immune responses against certain tumors and viruses, but also demonstrated a detrimental role of this receptor in autoimmune diseases (e.g., type I diabetes). &lt;/p&gt;
			The DAP12 signaling adapter associates with many different human and mouse receptors, including activating KIR, Ly49, CD94/NKG2C, and several myeloid receptors.  Like the CD3 subunits of the T cell antigen receptor, DAP12 has an immunoreceptor tyrosine&#45;based activation motif (ITAM) in its cytoplasmic domain.  When a DAP12&#45;associated receptor encounters its ligand, DAP12 is tyrosine phosphorylated, which results in the recruitment and activation of the tyrosine kinases ZAP70 or syk &#45; initiating cytokine production and cell&#45;mediated cytotoxicity.  DAP12&#45;associated receptors, such as Ly49H and Ly49P, are involved in immunity against cytomegalovirus infection. The goal of our research is to understand the role of these NK cell receptors in immune defense against tumors and microbial pathogens, and explore their potential detrimental role in autoimmune diseases. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;b&gt;Insulin Resistance and Obesity in Children  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			 Insulin is integral to normal energy balance. Most obese children are hyperinsulinemic. Two separate and mechanistically disparate, yet overlapping, disorders of insulin dynamics contribute to the development of hyperinsulinemia. These two disorders may have different implications for the pathogenesis of obesity, racial disparities in obesity and risk for cardiovascular (CV) morbidity, and treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
			 The first and most common insulin abnormality is hepatic/muscle insulin resistance, which leads to compensatory fasting hyperinsulinemia. Since the adipocyte retains relative insulin sensitivity, the excess insulin promotes lipogenesis and obesity, especially in visceral fat. Insulin resistance correlates with sympathetic modulation, CV reactivity, and the development of the Metabolic Syndrome. This is probably the disorder associated with the highest CV morbidity. We have shown that improvement of hepatic/muscle insulin sensitivity using the drug metformin leads to reductions in insulinemia, glycemia, and BMI in patients with insulin resistance. However, despite having severe insulin resistance, African&#45;Americans respond poorly to metformin monotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;
			 The second, less common insulin abnormality is glucose&#45;stimulated insulin hypersecretion due to &amp;szlig;&#45;cell dysfunction. These individuals have less visceral but more subcutaneous and gluteal fat. This form of hyperinsulinemia is correlated with increased vagal modulation. Insulin hypersecretion occurs in a subset of obese children who suffer cranial insult, so&#45;called &quot;hypothalamic obesity&quot;. We have shown in two studies (one pilot, and one double&#45;blind placebo&#45;controlled) that suppression of &amp;szlig;&#45;cell insulin secretion using the somatostatin agonist octreotide promotes weight loss in this syndrome. Yet glucose tolerance is maintained. We have also shown in two studies (one pilot, and one double&#45;blind placebo&#45;controlled) that a subset of normal obese adults (approx. 15%) manifest insulin hypersecretion and respond to octreotide with weight loss. Again, however, African&#45;Americans, despite have marked insulin hypersecretion, respond poorly to octreotide therapy. &lt;/p&gt;
			 There is no doubt that these two disorders of insulin are to some extent reciprocally related; worsening resistance leads to excessive secretion. In an attempt to sort out the primary role of these two processes, we evaluated the insulin response to an oral GTT in 119 obese children. We plotted an index of insulin secretion (Corrected Insulin Response, or CIR) against an index of insulin resistance (Composite Insulin Sensitivity Index, or CISI). We found that Caucasians invariably had no insulin abnormality, children with hypothalamic obesity manifested insulin hypersecretion, and African&#45;American subjects manifested both phenomena. Multiple linear regression analysis (when controlling for age, puberty, and BMI SDS) demonstrated that African&#45;Americans have 10% more severe insulin resistance than Caucasians, which was not significant, but 70% greater insulin hypersecretion which was highly significant. These data show that insulin hypersecretion and resistance are separate entities and have racial, etiopathogenic, and treatment implications. We have also shown that insulin sensitivity at baseline predicts the response of weight loss to lifestyle changes. Insulin resistance at baseline predicts weight loss response to insulin sensitization using the drug metformin. Insulin hypersecretion at baseline predicts weight loss response to insulin suppression using the drug octreotide. &lt;/p&gt;
			 Finally, we have demonstrated that insulin suppression improves leptin resistance, as leptin decreases, but resting energy expenditure increases. It appears that hyperinsulinemia is the proximate cause of leptin resistance. This has implications for the pharmacologic treatment of obesity. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;b&gt;Apolipoprotein E and HDL Levels   &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			 Apolipoprotein (apo) E, a key mediator of lipid transport, has three major isoforms that differ at two positions. The functional consequences of these structural differences are profound. ApoE2 is associated with type III hyperlipoproteinemia, and apoE4 with increased risk of atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. ApoE3 is considered the normal isoform. &lt;/p&gt;
			 ApoE is the critical ligand in the clearance of atherogenic remnant lipoproteins by the liver. A key molecule in their initial capture or sequestration in the space of Disse is heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG). Subsequent uptake by hepatocytes involves both low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors and the HSPG/LDL receptor&#45;related protein pathway. &lt;/p&gt;
			 We continue to study heart disease risk factors as part of our Turkish Heart Study. Compared to western Europeans or Americans, Turks have greater (25&#45;30%) hepatic lipase activity and lower (10&#45;15 mg/dl) levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL&#45;C). This striking reduction in HDL&#45;C occurs after puberty. The mean HDL&#45;C levels in Turkish boys drop from ~58 to 37 mg/dl and remain at 36&#45;37 mg/dl during adulthood. The HDL&#45;C levels in Turkish girls decrease from ~55 to 43 mg/dl and remain at 40&#45;43 mg/dl. &lt;/p&gt;
			 We are now looking for single nucleotide polymorphic sites in genes that may be associated with lipid abnormalities and coronary artery disease. For example, cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) is important in reverse cholesterol transport and HDL metabolism. More than 2000 random subjects from the Turkish Heart Study were screened for the CETP TaqIB polymorphism. The rare B2B2 genotype was associated with higher HDL&#45;C and lower CETP activity. The B1B1 genotype was associated with 5&#45;15% lower HDL&#45;C than the B2B2 genotype in both sexes, with an additional 8&#45;10% decrease in smokers. &lt;/p&gt;
			 We have also assessed two sites in ABCA1, which participates in HDL&#45;C formation. HDL&#45;C was 8&#45;10% higher in men (but not in women) with the rare &#45;14T allele than in those with the C&#45;14T promoter polymorphism. In combination with R219K, C&#45;14T increased HDL&#45;C in both sexes. The rare V771M polymorphism was associated with higher HDL&#45;C in men and, in combination with I883M, with higher HDL&#45;C in both sexes. HDL&#45;C levels in Turks may be modulated by an interaction between CETP polymorphisms and smoking and by ABCA1 polymorphisms. &lt;/p&gt;

			My current research is aimed at developing fast, high resolution magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and x&#45;ray based techniques, which in conjunction with image analysis and processing methods, may be used to derive quantitative information pertaining to tissue, organ morphology, and function. In the area of musculoskeletal applications, imaging plays a role in diagnosis, surgical planning, and guided surgical applications. However, beyond anatomical and subjective depictions of anatomy, quantitative, morphological and functional musculoskeletal imaging methods are still under&#45;utilized. My laboratory efforts are focused on the following projects. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;b&gt;Characterization of Trabecular Bone in Osteoporosis &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			Osteoporosis is characterized by a loss of bone mineral density and changes in trabecular bone architecture. In this area, my research program has been aimed at developing non&#45;invasive MR, micro computed tomography techniques and image processing methods to quantify trabecular bone density and structure. Collaborative studies and clinical trials have been conducted which indicate that MR techniques may potentially provide additional information relating to bone strength. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;b&gt;Characterizing Tissue Properties of Cartilage and Inter&#45;vertebral Disks &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			In collaboration with the Department of Orthopedic Surgery and Dr. Jeffrey Lotz, high resolution MR imaging, PET and CT are being used to quantify the structural properties of the intervertebral disk. We have recently installed an infra&#45;red tissue characterizing microscope and also extended our research collaborations with Dr. Kurhanewicz where high resolution magic angle spinning (NMR spectroscopy) is being used to identify markers of disc degeneration. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;b&gt; Osteoarthritis and Kinematics of the Knee Joint  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			In the area of osteoarthritis, high resolution MR imaging and quantitation of cartilage thickness, fraying, etc., is being conducted in collaboration with Drs. Steinbach and Ries (Orthopedic Surgery). In addition, Drs. Safran and Ma (Orthopedic Surgery) are collaborating in developing kinematic imaging of the knee joint and studying the complex kinematics of the knee in anterior cruciate ligament deficient knees. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;b&gt; Morphological and Functional Musculoskeletal Imaging  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			Synthesizing the overall focus of the above studies, I am now developing a partnership to study musculo&#45;skeletal morphology and function. This 5 year recently funded partnership sets the infrastructure for collaborations across different departments at UCSF, UC Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Labs and 3 industrial partners and aims to advance quantitative imaging to cover the entire musculo&#45;skeletal system. This is a technique&#45;driven development effort (rather than a disease&#45;focused, hypothesis&#45;driven project), but it will enhance many projects focusing on disease states and support the studies described above. &lt;/p&gt;

			Starting with the description of the phenotype of normotriglyceridemic abetalipoproteinemia and the later demonstration that it is based on a mutation in the gene for apolipoprotein B&#45;100, I have been involved in the description of a number of newly emerging genetic disorders leading to dyslipidemia. One is a form of hypertriglyceridemia related to a mutation in apolipoprotein C&#45;III. Several others lead to the phenotypes of hypobetalipoproteinemia. A prevalent disorder results in ligand&#45;defective hypercholesterolemia (apo B Arg 3500 Cys). Most recently, I have been involved in the elucidation of a new form of combined hyperlipidemia, due to mutations in the gene for cholesterol 7 alpha hydroxylase. This disorder is thought to affect at least one hundred thousand Americans. &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;b&gt; Identification of Novel Genes for Coronary Artery Disease and Stroke  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			I have had a major role in a genome scale effort to detect gene polymorphisms that are associated with stroke and coronary disease, including myocardial infarction. To date over 11,000 gene loci have been scanned, yielding 21 significant gene associations with coronary disease and 4 with stroke. &lt;/p&gt;

			I have a number of multidisciplinary collaborations that are ongoing. &lt;/p&gt;
			(1) The UCSF Diabetes Center has a major interest in the development of effective therapies for type 1 diabetes. Dr. Jeffrey Bluestone of the Diabetes Center has created a humanized monoclonal anti&#45;CD3 antibody which in experimental animals prevents the development of type 1 diabetes. I served as the Principal Investigator for the site for two multicenter phase 1, 2 clinical trials with this drug. These trials showed that the monoclonal antibody delayed the beta cell loss that occurs after the onset of type 1 diabetes mellitus. I have continuing clinical collaborations with Drs. Bluestone and Gitelman (Pediatric Endocrinology) with this and other immunomodulatory agents in the treatment of type 1 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;
			(2)The goal of the Islet Transplant Group (a collaboration between the Departments of Surgery and Medicine) is to develop protocols for establishment of long term insulin independence in patients with type 1 diabetes. As a member of the group, I participate in the recruitment, management of diabetes mellitus pre&#45;and posttransplantation and tests of beta cell function pre&#45; and post transplantation. I am also interested in examining the psychosocial impact of pancreas and islet transplantation and am setting up a protocol in collaboration with Dr. Lawrence Fisher in the Department of Family Medicine to do this. &lt;/p&gt;
			(3) Insulin resistance is an important component of the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. I have established the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp protocol at the UCSF General Clinical Research Center for the study of insulin resistance. Drs. Goldfine, Youngren and I are currently using this clamp protocol to study the effects of exercise training in insulin&#45;resistant nonobese nondiabetic subjects. We are starting a study examining the effect of chromium therapy on a similar cohort. &lt;/p&gt;
			(4) I am collaborating with Dr. Lawrence Fisher and colleagues (Departments of Family Medicine and Psychiatry) to examine the relationships between glycemic control, co&#45;morbidities, depression and psychosocial stress in two prospective cohorts. It has been hypothesized that psychosocial stress, through changes in cortisol secretory patterns, can lead to visceral obesity and insulin resistance, and he has just established a protocol for collection of salivary cortisol levels in these 2 cohorts to test this idea. &lt;/p&gt;

			My research is focused on signal transduction pathways in cancer cells and ways of treating cancer based on these pathways. The Ras pathway has been my primary interest. My lab is attempting to understand how oncogenic Ras alters cell growth and survival in cancer cells, and in cells from patients suffering from neurofibromatosis. The latter disease is caused by loss of a negative regulator of Ras of the Ras GAP family, a family of enzymes that was discovered in my lab. Loss of the neurofibromin protein leads to hyperactivation of Ras in cells of neural crest origin. As a result, patients expressing defective neurofibromin suffer from learning defects, multiple benign lesions, and an increased risk of certain cancers. We are using a combination of yeast genetics and biochemistry to understand more about the function of neurofibromin and how it is regulated, as well as new ways of treating this terrible disease. &lt;/p&gt;
			My lab has also analyzed the wnt, RB, and p53 signaling pathways. I am particularly interested in the role of the RB protein in cell differentiation and proliferation and the consequences of RB loss in breast cancer. We have analyzed ways in which the RB pathway is regulated in cancer cells and have investigated the role of CDKs in cell proliferation. Also, in the area of breast cancer research, we are investigating mechanisms of metastasis and of resistance to targeted therapies. &lt;/p&gt;
			My interest in p53 is based on my proposal to use adenoviruses to kill cancer cells selectively based on loss of p53 in these cells. My lab is actively working on this principle and on ways of making viral therapy more effective, including ways of re&#45;targeting adenovirus to cancer cells and a detailed analysis of RNA export and heat&#45;shock related responses in cancer cells and cells infected with adenovirus. &lt;/p&gt;

			My laboratory has three major interests. The first two focus on defining the biology of the host&#45;parasite relationship for global parasitic infections like schistosomiasis and trypanosomiasis. We are studying mechanisms by which parasites invade host tissue, metabolize host proteins like hemoglobin, and regulate the expression of virulence factors during different stages of their life cycle. A tangent of this research is the development of specific inhibitors targeting proteases necessary for parasitic invasion and metabolism. We are also defining the host immune response to schistosome parasites that results in granuloma formation and fibrosis. One particularly intriguing discovery has been that schistosomes exploit the immune response as a signal for growth and egg production. Our third area of interest is the role of proteases in tumor progression. We are evaluating the expression of proteases in both mouse models of tumor development and in actual human tumor specimens. We then map structure&#45;function relationships in tumor proteases with the goal of designing specific inhibitors as tools to probe the role of proteases in tumor progression and as leads for future chemotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;

			Work in my laboratory focuses on the role of oncogenes and tumor suppressors in the aberrant proliferation of cancer cells. The past 25 years have seen enormous progress in the elucidation of the fundamental mechanisms by which normal cells are converted to a tumorigenic phenotype. The general consensus is that activation of oncogenes such as Ras, accompanied by loss of function of tumor suppressor genes such as p53, promotes the conversion of normal cells to a neoplastic phenotype. Alterations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes leads to subversion of the machinery that controls the cell division cycle, cell senescence and the process of programmed cell death (apoptosis).
			&lt;/p&gt;
			The Ras&#45;family of membrane associated GTPases transmit signals into the interior of the cell by the activation of a number of cytosolic signal transduction pathways. Prominent among these is the Raf/MEK/ERK MAP kinase signaling pathway. Binding of Raf to activated Ras leads to activation of Raf protein kinase activity. Activated Raf phosphorylates to activate a second protein kinase MEK, which in turn phosphorylates to activate the MAP kinases ERK1 and 2. Activated ERKs are pleiotropic modulators of cell physiology that elicit their effects by phosphorylating numerous proteins including several transcription factors. Using conditionally active forms of Raf (DRaf:ER) that permit selective activation of the ERK MAP kinase pathway in cells we have explored the regulation of gene expression by this pathway. It is clear that the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway can contribute to many of the phenotypes of the cancer cell by regulating genes involved in the cell division cycle (cyclin D1, p21Cip1), apoptosis (Mdm2, HB&#45;EGF), cell invasion (avb3&#45;integrin), epithelial cell multilayering and angiogenesis (VEGF).  &lt;/p&gt;
			Although the molecular genetics of pancreatic cancer and melanoma have been explored in some detail, there is a large gap in our understanding of how mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressors influence the aberrant behavior of these tumors. Furthermore, both pancreatic cancer and melanoma are diseases for which there is an urgent need for new diagnostic and therapeutic tools. Consequently, we have initiated a series of new projects to understand the role of oncogenes and tumor suppressors in the initiation and progression of both pancreatic cancer and melanoma in more detail. We are taking three main approaches to explore fundamental aspects of the cell and molecular biology of these diseases. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;b&gt;Understanding the Cell of Origin&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			To understand the aberrant properties of the cancer cell, we need to know something about the properties of the normal cells from which the cancer cells are derived. To do this we have established conditions that allow the in vitro culture of human pancreatic ductal epithelial cells (PDEC) and melanocytes, the cells from which pancreatic cancer and melanoma arise respectively. By expression of telomerase or other &quot;immortalizing&quot; genes, we are attempting to isolate long&#45;term cultures of these cells. Such cell lines will then be subjected to an in&#45;depth analysis of the regulation of gene expression with particular emphasis on the control of the cell division cycle, apoptosis and senescence. In addition, we will use these cell lines as recipients in gene transfer experiments to explore the effects of activated Ras and Raf on human cells.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;b&gt;
			Understanding the Altered Properties of the Cancer Cell &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			Using human pancreatic cancer and melanoma cell lines, we are using high&#45;throughput profiling techniques to explore the genetic alterations and gene expression changes that occur in the initiation and progression of pancreatic cancer and melanoma. We are also assessing the effects of inhibitors of various cell signaling pathways on cancer cell physiology. Moreover, as new techniques become available to scan the proteome of human cancer cells, we will apply the full spectrum of high&#45;throughput profiling techniques to understand how alterations in the patterns of mRNA and protein expression contribute to the aberrant properties of these cells. Although the goal of this research is to understand the biology of the cancer cell, we anticipate that this analysis may ultimately lead to the identification of candidate diagnostic and therapeutic targets to aid in the management of these diseases &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;b&gt;Mouse Models of Pancreatic Cancer and Melanoma&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			To explore the initiation and progression of pancreatic cancer and melanoma in a true in vivo setting, we are deriving transgenic mice with tissue specific expression of oncogenes that will confer an inherited pre&#45;disposition either to pancreatic cancer or melanoma. These mice will then be bred to other transgenic/knock&#45;out mice to explore the role of specific oncogenes and tumor suppressors in the genesis and progression of pancreatic cancer and melanoma. These studies will focus in particular on genes that regulate the cell division cycle, apoptosis and senescence. Clearly, transgenic mouse models that accurately recapitulate the features of human cancer will be very useful tools in understanding the earliest stages of the initiation and progression of these diseases. Such mice may also be useful in testing new therapies to target these diseases. &lt;/p&gt;

			In the past few years several groups have published the sequences for over 1000 microRNAs from plants to humans and this number is growing. In fact, approximately 1% of all known human genes encode microRNAs, yet we know very little about their function. Our lab is interested in understanding how microRNAs contribute to the specification of cell fate and function, and how deregulation of microRNAs may contribute to human disease such as diabetes.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			The &lt;a href=&quot;http://mcmanuslab.ucsf.edu&quot;&gt;McManus lab&lt;/a&gt; studies basic biological processes relating to an important cellular pathway called RNA interference (RNAi), using cultured human cells and the mouse as a model. This includes the study of small (18&#45;26 nucleotide) regulatory RNAs of biological significance, such as microRNAs, and the factors involved in small RNA production and activity. We have generated a mouse knockout for the gene called Dicer, which is the catalytic engine of small RNA production in cells.  We have used this mouse to explore the role of small RNAs in many tissues and it is clear that they are key for normal cellular function.  For this reason, many mouse small RNA knockout models are being made and studied in collaboration with others at UCSF.  These studies will illuminate the role of small RNAs in basic biology and human disease.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			We are working hard to translate our basic research findings to our clinical and disease&#45;centric colleagues at UCSF.  We believe that the small regulatory RNAs that have been discovered are just the 'tip of the iceberg' in a set of important biology that we are far from understanding.  Based on our studies of this biology, we have developed cutting&#45;edge research tools and agents that usurp this pathway for the interrogation of gene function and the potential use in the intervention diabetes.  RNAi is significantly impacting the speed at which we can validate and deliver drugs to the clinic, and it very likely constitutes the next frontier in human therapeutics.

			My laboratory studies the molecular biology of human steroid hormone biosynthesis. Initial work concerned the identification of steroidogenic enzymes and the cloning of their cDNAs and genes. This included cDNAs or genes for the cholesterol side&#45;chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc), 17alpha hydroxylase/ 17,20 lyase (P450c17), 21 hydroxylase (P450c21), adrenodoxin reductase, adrenodoxin, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), vitamin D 1alpha hydroxylase (P450c1alpha) and two novel transcription factors (LBP&#45;1b and LBP&#45;9). We found that the extracellular matrix protein Tenascin&#45;X is one of several novel genes in the P450c21 gene locus. The regulation of each steroidogenic gene was studied at the levels of activity, mRNA expression and fine promoter analysis. Mutations were sought causing human disease. My laboratory provided key evidence showing that gene conversion was the principal mechanism causing 21&#45;hydroxylase deficiency and was first to determine the genetic basis of several diseases, including lipoid adrenal hyperplasia (StAR), isolated 17,20 lyase deficiency (electron transfer to P450c17), recessive Ehlers&#45;Danlos Syndrome (Tenascin&#45;X), vitamin D&#45;dependent rickets (P450c1alpha), and Antley&#45;Bixler Syndrome (P450 oxidoreductase). &lt;/p&gt;
			Present work focuses on three questions.  &lt;/p&gt;
			(1) What is the mechanism of action of StAR? Steroidogenic cells store little steroid, hence the acute regulation of steroidogenesis, such as the secretion of cortisol in response to ACTH, is mediated at the level of access of cholesterol to the first enzyme, P450scc, in the mitochondria. The influx of cholesterol is regulated by StAR, which exerts its actions on the outer mitochondrial membrane before being imported. We are determining what proteins StAR interacts with, what conformational changes it undergoes, and how these move cholesterol into mitochondria. &lt;/p&gt;
			(2) How is 17,20 lyase activity regulated? The 17,20 lyase activity of P450c17, which is required for all sex steroid synthesis, is regulated post&#45;translationally by factors that influence its association with P450 oxidoreductase. One of these is the phosphorylation of P450c17 itself. We are identifying the relevant kinase and its site of action, as this kinase may also play a significant role in the polycystic ovary syndrome. &lt;/p&gt;
			(3) Does P450 oxidoreductase (POR) play a significant role in the genetic variations in drug responses (pharmacogenomics)? POR transfers electrons to all microsomal P450s, including some steroidogenic enzymes and the major hepatic drug&#45;metabolizing enzymes. Although POR knockout mice are embryonic lethal, we found POR mutations causing a steroidogenic disorder. We are now identifying and characterizing the enzymatic activities of POR mutants and polymorphisms in ethnically diverse normal individuals. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;b&gt; Epithelial Polarity and Morphogenesis &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
			The most fundamental type of organization cells in metazoa  is that of epithelia.  Epithelial cells form sheets of cells that line surfaces and internal cavities.  Most internal organs in higher animals, such as the respiratory, digestive, genito&#45;urinary and vascular systems are lined by a single layer of epithelial cells.  We are studying both the structure of individual epithelial cells and how they are organized into multicellular tissues and organs. &lt;/p&gt;
			We are focused on 3 basic questions. &lt;/p&gt;
			(1) How is the polarization of epithelial cells determined?   Epithelial cells are highly polarized, with an apical surface facing the lumen of the cavity and a basolateral surface facing other cells and extracellular matrix.  Epithelial cells have a conserved set of protein complexes, such as the Par3/Par6 complex, which are needed for them to become polarized.  Upstream of these complexes, we have discovered a new pathway that determines the orientation of polarization, that is which way the cell points.  Alterations in this pathway can cause cells to reverse polarity, so that the apical surface now points away from the central lumen.  We have found that this pathway starts with assembly of the laminin&#45;rich extracellular matrix around the cells, followed by integrin signaling at the basolateral surface.  The signal for orientation of polarity must then move across the cells. This may be mediated by transcellular movement of the small GTPase, Cdc42.   Finally, Cdc42 apparently promotes the organization of the Par3/Par6 and other complexes at the apical surface of the cell. &lt;/p&gt;
			(2) Once the initial orientation of polarity is determined, how does the cell execute this program to become fully polarized?   The apical and basolateral surfaces of the cell have completely different protein and lipid compositions, and so the cell has mechanisms to specifically sort these components to one surface or the other.  The lipid phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5&#45;P3 (PIP3) is a crucial determinant of this process.  Normally, PIP3 is found only at the basolateral surface. Ectopic localization of PIP3 to the apical surface can transform this apical surface into basolateral surface, by causing the relocalization of normally basolateral proteins to the apical surface, as well as removal of apical proteins from this transformed surface. Proteins and lipids are transported to the apical or basolateral surfaces by vesicular carriers.  The fusion of these carriers with the surface involves syntaxin proteins, which are found on the target membrane.  We have found that syntaxin 4 is exclusively basolateral, while syntaxin 3 is exclusively apical.  Ectopic localization of syntaxin 3 to the basolateral surface causes misdelivery of apical proteins to the basolateral surface. These data indicate that PIP3 and syntaxins specify where vesicles are delivered to in the cell. &lt;/p&gt;
			(3) The basic building block of most epithelial organs are tubes, lined by epithelial cells.  How do epithelial cells organize themselves into tubes?   We have found that when epithelia cells remodel to form tubes, they start by partially de&#45;differentiating, losing their epithelial polarity, and taking on many of the properties of migrating fibroblasts.  The cells then migrate to positions where they will form the new tube.  The cells then re&#45;differentiate, reacquiring epithelial polarity and creating new lumens between the cells.  Tubulogenesis can thus be conceptualized as occurring in two stages, de&#45;differentiation and re&#45;differentiation. &lt;/p&gt;

			 Innate immune cells are important sensors of their microenvironment and provide early responses to infectious, neoplastic and environmental stresses. Their effector functions are closely regulated through a balance of signals mediated through a variety of activating and inhibitory cell surface receptors. Our laboratory has focused on the study of receptors that regulate cells in the innate immune system. We have focused on receptors on natural killer cell lymphocytes until recently. We are now examining similar receptors on osteoclasts. These recent studies demonstrated that innate immune receptors are critical regulators of osteoclast development and function, thus osteoclasts should be considered an integral part of the innate immune system. &lt;/p&gt;
			 Our current studies focus on: (1) identification of receptors and their ligands in both NK cells and osteoclasts, (2) delineation of signaling pathways utilized by these receptors in specific cellular functions, and (3) determining the role of specific receptors in the regulation of immune responses, autoimmunity and bone remodeling. We are examining the roles of specific NK cell receptors in specific animal models involving immune&#45;mediated tumor rejection and an established model for systemic lupus erythematosus, the NZB/W mouse. The roles of specific osteoclast receptors will be evaluated in several murine models of active bone remodeling including estrogen loss, parathyroid hormone infusion, and glucocorticoid administration. Our overall goal remains to better define the roles of innate immune receptors and their immunoregulatory effects so as to better understand their contribution to the autoimmune and normal immune responses. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;b&gt;PTH Signaling in Bone  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
			My laboratory has focused on better understanding how parathyroid hormone (PTH) activates its receptor in bone and kidney and how this activation is regulated at the molecular level. Recently, we have expanded our research efforts to examine how a variety of G protein signals in osteoblasts interact with other signaling pathways to control bone resorption and bone formation in vivo . The long&#45;term goal of this work is to better define how intracellular signaling in response to PTH and other calciotropic factors produces anabolic effects on the skeleton. This will provide key basic information for the development of strategies for the treatment of osteopenic disorders such as osteoporosis. &lt;/p&gt;
			Signal transduction by the PTH receptor is limited by regulation at the level of receptor phosphorylation, association of members of the arrestin protein family with the receptor, and receptor endocytosis. My research focuses on identifying the basis for receptor phosphorylation, sites of binding of arrestin to the receptor, and the intracellular trafficking pathway of the receptor after agonist binding. We are using a combination of mutagenesis, biochemistry, and confocal microscopy to examine these issues in HEK&#45;293 cells expressing recombinant wildtype and mutated PTH receptors. We have successfully mapped the sites of agonist&#45;stimulated phosphorylation in the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor and have identified the role of G protein&#45;coupled receptor kinases. We have also established that arrestin binding, as well as an endocytic motif in the receptor's cytoplasmic tail, contribute to endocytosis and, thereby, down&#45;regulation of the PTH receptor. We are currently defining the nature of this trafficking pathway. &lt;/p&gt;
			We are also investigating the interaction between PTH receptor signaling and canonical Wnt signaling in bone. The rationale behind these studies is the recent finding that disruption of canonical Wnt signaling results in osteoporosis, whereas gain&#45;of&#45;function mutations in a gene in this pathway result in a heritable high bone mass phenotype in humans. We have found that PTH receptor activation results in convergent signaling with the canonical Wnt pathway. Specifically, PTH receptor signaling stabilizes beta&#45;catenin and, thereby, increases the activity of LEF/TCF transcription factors in osteoblasts. We are in the process of defining the mechanism underlying this effect of PTH receptor activation and are planning experiments to assess whether this convergent signaling contributes to the anabolic effect of exogenous PTH in bone. &lt;/p&gt;
			Finally, we have developed a tetracycline&#45;based gene expression system to control the activity of target transgenes in osteoblasts in vivo  and in vitro . We are collaborating with Bruce Conklin (UCSF Gladstone Institute) to target G protein&#45;coupled receptors and activated G proteins to osteoblasts in order to investigate the effects of specific G protein signals on bone formation. In our initial studies, we have found that induction of continuous Gi signaling in osteoblasts in mice from 4&#45;12 weeks of age results in significant trabecular bone loss. We are currently investigating the mechanism of this effect in cultured osteoblasts. We are also planning to assess the effect of other G protein signals delivered at various times of osteoblast development. &lt;/p&gt;

			 My research focus is on the mechanisms and biology of intracellular protein misfolding, with the ultimate goal of understanding the molecular bases of &#45; and eventually developing novel therapeutics for &#45; the protein misfolding diseases. Specifically, my efforts center on type 2 diabetes, for which evidence is accruing that it represents an example of a protein misfolding disease. &lt;/p&gt;
			 To study intracellular protein misfolding, I will focus on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which in eukaryotic cells is a protein&#45;folding factory and a way station for proteins destined for the cell exterior or other distal destinations. These secretory and transmembrane proteins are injected during their biogenesis in an unfolded state into the ER, where they must complete folding without aggregating. A plethora of ER&#45;resident activities (the protein&#45;folding machinery) facilitates this process. Insufficient ER protein&#45;folding capacity leads to an accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen (referred to as ER stress) and triggers an adaptive mechanism called the unfolded protein response (UPR), which in S. cerevisiae causes induction of a major transcriptional program to alleviate ER stress. Transcriptionally&#45;upregulated genes in the UPR include those encoding chaperones, oxido&#45;reductases, phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes, ER&#45;associated degradation (ERAD) components, and many proteins functioning downstream in the secretory pathway. These activities act in concert to override and extinguish ER stress. &lt;/p&gt;
			 ER stress is sensed by a bifunctional ER transmembrane kinase/RNase, called Ire1. Upon accumulation of ER misfolded proteins, Ire1 is activated and initiates non&#45;conventional splicing of the mRNA encoding the Hac1 transcriptional activator. This splicing event relieves translational attenuation of HAC1 mRNA; consequently the accumulation of Hac1 protein causes upregulation of UPR targets. Using a chemical&#45;genetic approach, I have recently discovered that upon ER unfolded protein accumulation, Ire1's kinase domain engages adenosine nucleotide, throwing a conformational switch to activate its HAC1 mRNA&#45;specific RNase. In the course of this work, I developed novel tools to manipulate the yeast UPR using cell&#45;permeable drugs which target Ire1's kinase domain. These tools will be exploited further to dissect the molecular mechanism of signaling in the mammalian UPR by Ire1. &lt;/p&gt;
			 For mammalian cells, cellular survival during ER stress requires the UPR. The mammalian UPR remodels the environment of the ER to respond to ER stress through two mechanisms: (1) as with yeast, a massive transcriptional up&#45;regulation of UPR target genes, and (2) a global translational down&#45;regulation, which reduces the load of secretory and transmembrane proteins delivered to the ER. The transcriptional arm of the UPR is controlled by the mammalian Ire1 ortholog, Ire1a, and the translational arm is controlled by the ER&#45;transmembrane eIF&#45;2a kinase, Perk. &lt;/p&gt;
			 I plan to study the biological consequences of unchecked ER stresses on mammalian cells and in living mice, using type 2 diabetes as a model disease. Evidence is mounting that a serious physiological consequence of unchecked ER stress on pancreatic islet &amp;szlig;&#45;cells is apoptosis, leading to type 2 diabetes. (1) Perk &#45;/&#45; mice accumulate unfolded proteins in the ER of several professional secretory tissues and develop infantile diabetes due to rapid &amp;szlig;&#45;cell death early in life. (2) The Akita diabetic mouse mutant misfolds a variant proinsulin, leading to proteotoxicity in the ER. (3) The human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) is a common amyloidogenic &amp;szlig;&#45;cell proteotoxin, known to cause &amp;szlig;&#45;cell ER damage, which may lead to diabetes in humans. Together, the implications of these studies lead to a unified hypothesis wherein misfolded protein buildup in the ER of pancreatic islet &amp;szlig;&#45;cells is deleterious for their long&#45;term function and survival. &lt;/p&gt;
			 Building on these studies, I will investigate specifically what role is played by the mammalian UPR in containing the various ER stresses that cause &amp;szlig;&#45;cell attrition, and which could lead to diabetes. A classical genetic (gene &quot;knockout&quot;) approach to this question is complicated by the fact that IRE1a is essential for mouse development, and perk &#45;/&#45; mice have pleiotropic defects in several organ systems, which lead to death early in life. As an alternative approach I am developing systems for conditionally manipulating the two arms of the mammalian UPR so as to observe the specific effects of unchecked ER stress on pancreatic islet &amp;szlig;&#45;cells in the living mouse. To this end, I will use chemical&#45;genetic approaches, which permit highly&#45;specific drug targeting of modified Ire1a and Perk kinase domains, using cell&#45;permeable ATP&#45;competitive drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
			 As I have successfully validated this approach for conditional control of the yeast UPR &#45; it is now possible to switch off the UPR even during ER stress, and switch on the UPR even in the absence of ER stress&#45;conditional manipulation of the two arms of the mammalian UPR is being developed. This will be accomplished by gene targeting of the IRE1 a and PERK kinase domain&#45;coding regions in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells to generate &quot;knock&#45;in&quot; mice whose Ire1 a and Perk gene products are sensitized to these ATP&#45;competitive drugs. The biological consequences of these manipulations on b &#45;cells will be studied in these knock&#45;in mice mutants and also in the genetic backgrounds of Akita and hIAPP to test the hypothesis that a crippled UPR promotes diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;

			Work in my laboratory focuses on mechanisms of hormone signaling, particularly as it relates to aldosterone&#45;regulated ion transport in the kidney. Aldosterone is the principal regulator of salt and volume homeostasis in mammals, and as such, defects in its cellular actions, or in the gene products it regulates, are major causes of both hypertension and salt&#45;wasting disorders. The receptor for aldosterone, the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), is a hormone&#45;activated transcription factor. We have focused on understanding how it regulates gene transcription and on how the regulated gene products in turn control cellular functions, particularly ion transport. Two major themes underlie our work. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			 &lt;b&gt; The Role of Sgk Kinases in Controlling Ion Transport in Epithelia &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			 We identified Sgk1 in a subtractive library by searching for aldosterone early response genes. Sgk1 is a serine&#45;threonine kinase whose gene transcription is stimulated by aldosterone and whose activity is controlled by PI3&#45;kinase. Work from our lab and others have confirmed the physiological relevance of Sgk1, which at present remains the only aldosterone target gene with a proven physiological role in epithelial ion transport. We have shown that Sgk1 stimulates sodium transport by regulating membrane trafficking of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). Current efforts focus on the underlying mechanisms. In particular, our recent collaborative work has shown that Sgk1 acts to inhibit a ubiquitin ligase, Nedd4&#45;2, which itself triggers ENaC internalization and blocks its trafficking to the plasma membrane. We have found that phosphorylation of Nedd4&#45;2 recruits a chaperone protein that inhibits Nedd4&#45;2. Furthermore, we have found that Sgk1 acts as an integrator of aldosterone and insulin regulation of Na + transport. Sgk1 is targeted to the appropriate subcellular location by a combination of protein&#45;protein and protein&#45;lipid interactions. These latter observations provide targets for identification of novel treatments for hypertension. We recently knocked out one of the Sgk isoforms (Sgk3) in mice and are characterizing its phenotype. &lt;/p&gt;
			 &lt;b&gt;Basic Mechanisms of MR Regulation of Gene Transcription  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			 MR is a hormone&#45;activated transcription factor that can both stimulate or repress gene transcription. We are interested in the mechanistic basis of receptor function as a transcription factor, particularly determinants of its specificity. Synergistic regulation of gene transcription is an important determinant of receptor specificity. We have identified a synergy control circuit, involving the DNA&#45;binding domain and a short motif in the receptor N&#45;terminus. Binding to DNA not only brings MR into the vicinity of regulated genes, but also exerts regulatory effects of its own on the receptor. We identified an important determinant of this signal detection system, which informs the receptor when it is bound to various types of DNA sites (response elements). Binding as a dimer to a palindromic response element engages the synergy control function, which induces SUMO&#45;1 (small ubiquitin&#45;like modifier) modification of a regulatory sequence (synergy control motif) in the receptor N&#45;terminal domain. We are currently examining how SUMO&#45;1 ligases (which are similar in function to ubiquitin ligases) modify the synergy control motif. We are also examining how MR specifically regulates transcription of the Sgk1 gene.  &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;b&gt;Studies of Germ Cell Development from hESCs  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) were first derived in 1998. Since that time, there has been much excitement regarding their potential for novel therapies. Yet, few studies have explored the basic properties of hESCs. We have characterized three major properties of independently&#45;derived hESC lines, on the NIH registry, that we grow in my laboratory [HSF1 and HSF6 (from UCSF) and H1, H7, H9 and H14 (from WiCell)], in detail: (1) differentiation potential, (2) genetic imprinting status, and (3) gene expression and generation of hESCs. &lt;/p&gt;
			These studies have led to several surprising results. First, we demonstrated that hESCs can differentiate not only to somatic cell lineages but also to the germ cell lineage. This is a fundamental property of mouse ESCs that has been used to distinguish &quot;good from bad&quot; lines. It indicates that hESCs possess potential beyond that which we initially expected and clearly indicates that hESCs are not restricted in their potential to sub&#45;branches of somatic development. Furthermore, the ability to differentiate hESCs to the germline will revolutionize human genetic studies of infertility and germ cell development. For the first time, we can dissect the function of genes, such as the DAZ ( Deleted in AZoospermia) genes (which we previously identified), during germ cell development on the background of the human genome. Second, we observed that genetic imprinting, at different loci, is variable in different hESC lines. The human genome contains at least 77 imprinted loci; imprinting at each may ultimately bear upon the utility of hESCs in therapeutics as abnormal imprinting can lead to tumorigenesis. Our studies allowed us to probe this important property in hESCs and in human germ cells differentiated from hESCs. Third, we observed that gene expression in hESCs and in cells isolated from the inner cell mass is distinctly different indicating that these two cells types are not equivalent. Further, we noted that expression of germ cell specific proteins in hESCs is noted throughout the cell colonies but is absent in cells of the inner cell mass. These observations suggest to us that hESCs appear to be an epiblast derivative, most closely related to embryonic germ cells, that have developed beyond the initial state of inner cell mass cells. These basic studies form the foundation for our research and for the formation of a program in human embryonic stem cell biology as described below. &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;b&gt;The Program in Human Embryonic Stem Cell Biology &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			The newly developed tools of human genetics and human embryonic stem cell biology have strengthened our resolve to pursue human biology. Yet, human genetics has long suffered from the lack of a rigorous system to experimentally manipulate human genes of interest and likewise, human stem cell biology suffers for lack of genetic rigor in its early stages. An overall goal of the Program in Human Embryonic Stem Cell Biology is to establish a combined program of human genetics and stem cell biology that allows the use of stem cells to address human genetic questions and vice versa. In addition, the program will train physicians in rigorous genetics and stem cell biology and train basic scientists in rigorous analysis of clinical problems. &lt;/p&gt;
			Experiments in my own laboratory will focus on characterization of fundamental properties of hESCs, in particular, the analysis of cell types differentiated, imprinting and gene expression. These experiments will require the same reagents that are already, or soon will be, required by other UCSF researchers: (1) multiple NIH&#45;approved lines, (2) newly&#45;derived lines cultured on human feeder cells, (3) ability to silence, disrupt and overexpress genes specifically in human ES cells, and (4) ability to transplant labelled cells to an appropriate model in vivo (primates or rodents). Thus, the Program in Human Embryonic Stem Cell Biology fuses the activities of generation of hESC lines and genetic modification and transplantation of undifferentiated and differentiated cell types. The fusion of hESC biology with human genetics will increase the power of both at UCSF. The program is co&#45;directed by me (UCSF School of Medicine) and Dr. Susan J Fisher (Tissue and Cell Biology; UCSF School of Dentistry). &lt;/p&gt;

			I have extensive experience in GCRC&#45;based human investigation in the area of vitamin D and phosphorus metabolism. Specifically, my work has been in the pathogenesis of secondary hyperparathyroidism in chronic renal failure; regulation of 1,25&#45;dihydroxyvitamin D metabolism by phosphorus; the effect of aging on regulation of vitamin D metabolism; the effect of aging on parathyroid function; and bone loss after renal transplantation. I led the group that cloned the vitamin D 1 a &#45;hydroxylase gene and continue to work on the molecular regulation of this gene by phosphorus and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF&#45;23). I continue to investigate the molecular genetic basis of autosomal recessive 1 a &#45;hydroxylase deficiency, work which follows the identification of the first mutations in this gene in affected patients. &lt;/p&gt;

			Research training typically follows one of two pathways, the Basic Scientist Pathway and the Clinical Investigator Pathway.&lt;p&gt;
			
			&lt;b&gt;Basic Scientist Pathway&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			
			Recognizing that our pool of fellows consists of individuals with disparate backgrounds in science and research, there are several options for training in basic research.&lt;p&gt;
			
			One option consists of being mentored in the laboratory of an established bench investigator and supplementing practical lab&#45;based training with formal courses in cell biology, molecular biology, genetics, immunology, biochemistry, and other topics offered through the UCSF graduate programs [e.g., the Biomedical Sciences (BMS) Program or the Program in Biologic Sciences (PIBS)].&lt;p&gt;
			
			A second option, often pursued by endocrine fellows with previous research experience, is to have their research training experience take place in the laboratory of their chosen mentor, supplemented with ongoing seminars and conferences in that laboratory or department.&lt;p&gt;
			
			A third option would be to apply to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://medicine.ucsf.edu/molmed/&quot;&gt;UCSF Molecular Medicine Training Program&lt;/a&gt; (MMTP) for a research fellowship. This competitive institution&#45;wide program provides fellowship support for trainees to pursue one year of formal course&#45;work and seminars in molecular and cell biology. This is combined with in&#45;depth research under the guidance of a mentor in the MMTP. The MMTP program faculty is larger and broadly based. Many faculty serving as mentors for the DEM Program are also faculty in the MMTP. More information on this training option is available when you visit our program.&lt;p&gt;
			
			A fourth option is to pursue a PhD degree in the BMS Program at UCSF, an elite graduate program in integrative biology with an emphasis on the study of human disease. One can apply to this program before or after arriving on campus.&lt;p&gt;
			
			&lt;b&gt;Clinical Investigator Pathway&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			
			Like the Basic Scientist Pathway, this program recognizes the need for an organized preparation for individual research training. The required curriculum for this pathway includes the ORACLE and ATCR (Advanced Training in Clinical Research) courses offered by the UCSF Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics. These courses cover basic clinical study design, biostatistics, epidemiology and medical ethics. These courses are described in detail in an accompanying brochure.&lt;p&gt;
			
			Clinical research training for a DEM fellow is typically jointly mentored by a faculty member from one of the Endocrinology or Metabolism Divisions of one of our three hospitals and a faculty member from the Epidemiology/Biostatistics Department at UCSF. The clinical research training experience is planned by the fellow in conjunction with his/her chosen preceptors and includes a variety of topics in hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular endocrinology, osteoporosis, growth hormone therapy, pituitary and adrenal disorders, wasting syndromes, and diabetes. Available research projects span the full range of clinical investigation, from studies of metabolism in the General Clinical Research Center to epidemiologic aspects of osteoporosis.&lt;p&gt;
			
			Plans for research training and selection of mentors are discussed with the Program Director and endocrine faculty in the first year of training. Regardless of the training option chosen, fellows will choose a mentor from approximately 75 distinguished research faculty at UCSF. Faculty are drawn from ten academic departments (Anatomy, Biochemistry, Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Physiology, Pharmacology, Medicine, Pediatrics, Obstetrics/Gynecology, Radiology and Surgery) and represent every discipline within endocrinology and its related basic and clinical sciences. The breadth of research opportunities available to trainees is illustrated by the attached research summaries. About one&#45;half of trainees in either of these pathways typically choose a preceptor outside the Department of Medicine.&lt;p&gt;
			
			Research training in the DEM Program is primarily funded by a Training Grant from the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIH.&lt;p&gt;
			
			&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.epibiostat.ucsf.edu/courses/post.html&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;UCSF Training in Clinical Research Program&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			
			There is an increasing need for highly qualified clinical investigators, defined as those participating in patient&#45;oriented, translational, epidemiologic, behavioral, outcomes or health services research.&lt;p&gt;
			
			The overall mission of the UCSF Training in Clinical Research (TICR) Program is to increase the number and quality of clinical investigators. This is achieved by offering a broad array of educational opportunities in the methods of clinical research to meet the diverse needs of trainees, faculty and staff at UCSF.&lt;p&gt;

			My current research includes both basic science and clinical investigation. My laboratory work is focused on two aspects of insulin&#45;like growth factor (IGF) biology. First, we are exploring the mechanisms by which IGFs regulate the differentiation of skeletal muscle cells. In particular, we have focused on the unique ability of IGFs to stimulate both the proliferation and differentiation of these cells. Specifically, we have studied target genes of IGF action and intracellular signaling pathways which influence the decision of skeletal myoblasts to proliferate or differentiate in response to IGFs. We are currently assessing the roles of Erk 1 and 2 and Akt in mediating the switch in IGF&#45;I action from inhibiting to stimulating the transcription of myogenin, a member of the MyoD family of transcription factors that is essential for myogenic differentiation. In addition, we are characterizing IGF&#45;responsive regions in the myogenin gene, with specific focus on binding sites for Myocyte Enhancer Factor 2 and Serum Response Factor. &lt;/p&gt;
			Since 2003, our lab has embarked on a second aspect of IGF biology: exploring the role of IGF signaling in the motility and invasiveness of human neuroblastoma (NBL) cells. In collaborative studies, we have observed that small molecule inhibitors of IGF&#45;I receptor activation block NBL growth, survival, and motility. &lt;/p&gt;
			With respect to clinical investigation, I am an active member of the UCSF Diabetes Center and am Co&#45;Investigator for TrialNet, a multicenter NIH&#45;sponsored study focused on developing therapies to prevent type 1 diabetes mellitus in high risk individuals. &lt;/p&gt;
			In addition, we have recently identified and characterized novel activating mutations in the V2 vasopressin receptor that cause a syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH)&#45;like phenotype, yet without detectable ADH. We have named this syndrome &quot;Nephrogenic Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuresis&quot; (NSIAD) and have reported our findings in the New England Journal of Medicine (352:34&#45;40, 2005). I am currently overseeing collaborative basic and clinical studies of NSIAD with the goals of further understanding the pathophysiology of this syndrome and potentially developing targeted treatments. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;b&gt;Developmental Genetics of the Drosophila Neuroendocrine System and Diabetes  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			Our main research goal is to understand the cell differentiation pathway of insulin&#45;producing cells, such as pancreatic islet beta&#45;cells.  Loss of insulin&#45;producing beta&#45;cells underlies the endpoint of diabetes type I and II. A key to treating these diseases lies in understanding the developmental pathway of beta&#45;cells and applying this to the programming of stem cells for beta&#45;cell replacement. With a desire to contribute to the treatment and cure for diabetes, we have turned to the fruit fly and genetics to study the developmental origins and cell biology of the pancreatic islet cells in a model system.  &lt;/p&gt;
			Drosophila has no pancreas, but the fly does have cell types with homologous functions to pancreatic islet cells. We have now identified a single neural stem cell progenitor (neuroblast) for the brain insulin&#45;producing neurosecretory cells (IPCs), which are analogous to islet beta&#45;cells. Likewise, we identified a second neuroblast for cells of the corpora cardiaca that are homologous to the glucagon&#45;secreting islet alpha&#45;cells. Remarkably, both progenitors originate as neighboring cells within an anterior head neuroectoderm domain that shares striking molecular orthology to the vertebrate hypophyseal placode, the source of endocrine anterior pituitary and neurosecretory hypothalamic cells. This ontogenic&#45;molecular concordance suggests that the brain endocrine axis arose originally in the common ancestor of humans and flies, where it orchestrated islet endocrine functions with insulin and glucagon&#45;like hormones. The fact that the insulin and glucagon&#45;secreting cells are specified from a common anlage in both flies and vertebrates suggests that there are evolutionarily conserved cell specification mechanisms for brain endocrine cells and pancreatic islet cells. &lt;/p&gt;
			The development of the Drosophila neuroblast lineage is a well established and powerful paradigm to understand the genetic control of cell fate specification and organogenesis. Guided by this basic paradigm, we are beginning to dissect the genetic control of the two lineages that generate the fly islet&#45;like cells. We are currently working to address the following questions: How do the &quot;placode genes&quot; control development of IPC and CC cell lineages? How does the early segmentation gene hierarchy establish the expression of placode genes in the anterior head? How is the further compartmentalization and patterning of this region achieved? Is there a combinatorial code of gene activity that is sufficient to specify these cells? How is the stem cell lineage genetically controlled to produce the correct number and fates of cells? Most importantly, which of these mechanisms play a role in beta&#45;cell programming in people, and how can this information be applied to the programming of beta&#45;cells from embryonic and other adult stem cells? &lt;/p&gt;

			 A major goal of my laboratory has been to understand the pathogenesis of HIV&#45;associated metabolic and morphologic abnormalities and evaluate potential therapeutic options, using a paradigm based on intensive metabolic ward assessments in which each subject serves as his or her own control. In such studies, we found that a pharmacologic dose of growth hormone (GH) reduced total, trunk and visceral fat and improved lipid profiles in HIV&#45;infected men with fat accumulation. However, GH also impaired insulin action in both muscle and liver, thus limiting its potential therapeutic value. In studies undertaken recently under the auspices of an investigator&#45;initiated IND with funding from the NIH, we are evaluating a novel treatment strategy using insulin&#45;like growth factor&#45;I (IGF&#45;I), which has been shown to reduce fat and enhance lipid oxidation while improving insulin sensitivity, in a formulation in which it is complexed to its major binding protein, IGFBP&#45;3, to enhance bioavailability and safety. We have hypothesized that IGF&#45;I/IGFBP&#45;3 will achieve both fat&#45;mobilizing and insulin&#45;sensitizing effects in patients with HIV infection and thus provide a therapeutic advantage over GH. In this proof&#45;of&#45;principle study, we are performing intensive metabolic ward studies to evaluate the effect of three months of treatment with IGF&#45;I/IGFBP&#45;3 on body fat content and distribution and lean body and muscle mass (DEXA and MRI), intramyocellular lipid levels (proton spectroscopy), insulin&#45;mediated glucose uptake and disposal (euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp with indirect calorimetry), oral glucose tolerance, integrated lipid and carbohydrate metabolism (stable isotope studies of glucose production, gluconeogenesis, lipolysis, de novo  lipogenesis), and plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels.  &lt;/p&gt;
			 An even more prevalent body composition abnormality in patients with HIV infection is peripheral lipoatrophy, characterized by striking depletion of fat depots in the arms, legs, buttocks and face. Depletion of fat stores is associated with insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hepatic steatosis in both non&#45;HIV infected patients with congenital or acquired lipoatrophy and transgenic mice engineered to be virtually free of white fat. Since these patients and mice are markedly hypoleptinemic and since leptin administration ameliorates their metabolic abnormalities, we obtained funding to test the hypotheses that treatment with leptin will: improve hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity and overall carbohydrate metabolism; ameliorate abnormalities in lipid metabolism; and decrease visceral adiposity, hepatic volume, and intramyocellular lipid levels in HIV&#45;infected patients with lipoatrophy. This open&#45;label, proof&#45;of&#45;principle study will employ a metabolic ward approach and similar state&#45;of&#45;the art methods as described in our studies employing IGF&#45;I/IGFBP&#45;3. Should the results of either of these preliminary studies be positive, they would provide a rationale for further studies of these agents, including randomized, double&#45;blind, placebo&#45;controlled trials. &lt;/p&gt;

			Our laboratory studies the intranuclear organization of the proteins that regulate the genome to be selectively transcribed in different cell types. Our hypothesis is that the intranuclear positions of gene regulatory factors control their access to specific sets of genes. In cell types associated with metabolism (anterior pituitary, fat) or that respond to estradiol (pituitary, breast and uterus), we have found that each factor takes up characteristic positions within the nucleus. Moreover, those positions of these factors are highly plastic and are altered by conditions such as the expression of another gene regulatory factor or the addition of a hormone. &lt;/p&gt;
			As an example, we found the transcription factor C/EBPa to concentrate in transcriptionally quiescent subregions of both anterior pituitary and adipocyte cell nuclei. Certain C/EBPa mutations resulted in the re&#45;distribution of C/EBPa to more transcriptionally active regions. A pituitary&#45;specific transcription factor Pit&#45;1 distinguishes anterior pituitary cells from adipocytes. We found co&#45;expression of Pit&#45;1 to be required for the transcriptional activation of pituitary&#45;specific promoters by C/EBPa. Pit&#45;1 expression in pituitary progenitor cells was associated with the re&#45;location of C/EBPa from the transcriptionally inactive subcompartment to the transcriptionally active subcompartment where C/EBPa activated pituitary&#45;specific promoters. &lt;/p&gt;
			Pit&#45;1 mutants, found in human patients with combined pituitary hormone deficiency, did not co&#45;activate C/EBPa transcriptional activity, and no longer re&#45;located C/EBPa from the transcriptionally inactive subcompartment. We also characterized mutations within C/EBPa that, even in the absence of Pit&#45;1 co&#45;expression, re&#45;located C/EBPa to the transcriptionally active subcompartment. These studies proved that C/EBPa was held inactive when localized to the transcriptionally quiescent subregion and that Pit&#45;1 re&#45;location of C/EBPa permitted activity. We also found that the anti&#45;proliferative actions of C/EBPa, common to both pituitary and adipocyte differentiation, was not affected by the intranuclear compartmentalization of C/EBPa. Thus, transcription factor compartmentalization can affect transcriptional capacity without affecting the molecular mechanisms involved in the control of cell replication. &lt;/p&gt;
			Other factors, including nuclear receptors and co&#45;factors that mediate estrogen, thyroid hormone and retinoid response localized to specific subregions of the nucleus. Each location may permit location&#45;selective activities or interactions for each factor. We pioneered methods for studying the biochemical interactions and conformations of the gene regulatory factors at specific locations within the cell nucleus. This was measured as the transfer of fluorescence energy between fluorophores attached to different gene regulatory factors or to different domains within the factor. For example, we determined that the positions of the DNA binding domains in C/EBPa dimers were ~2? further apart at the transcriptionally inactive regions of the nucleus than at the transcriptionally active regions. &lt;/p&gt;
			We also use these high&#45;precision, live&#45;cell, FRET techniques to measure the effects of drugs, used in the treatment of breast cancer, prostate cancer and diabetes on the interactions of the relevant transcription factors with themselves or with other factors. &lt;/p&gt;

			Most often, the metabolic disorders of carbohydrate (CHO) and fat metabolism have been studied independently, and the importance of their mutual interaction has been overlooked. My interest in the inter&#45;relationship between CHO and fat metabolism was triggered by the fact that, although individuals with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes are identified and treated for their problems with CHO homeostasis, they often have equally important perturbations of fat homeostasis (dyslipidemia) and are more likely to die from cardiovascular diseases. For these reasons, I have concentrated my research efforts on whole body and hepatic fuel homeostasis with special attention to the inter&#45;relationship between carbohydrate and fat metabolism. &lt;/p&gt;
			I felt that studying simultaneously  the interplay between hepatic  de novo lipogenesis  ( DNL), glucose production and gluconeogenesis (GNG) would lead to a better understanding of the pathophysiology at the origin of hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycemia. Indeed, the pathway converting CHO to fat (DNL) shares precursors with the GNG pathway and is a biochemical bridge between CHO and fat metabolism. This latter fact and our preliminary studies led me to hypothesize that hepatic DNL was an important regulatory pathway diverting part of the GNG flux to better control GNG and glucose production. &lt;/p&gt;
			We chose three main approaches to test this hypothesis in humans. One approach was to stimulate hepatic DNL by energy overfeeding with CHO or by feeding energy balanced high CHO diets and to monitor how this affects glucose production in healthy controls. The second approach was to utilize insulin resistant patients (such as obese and critically ill patients) who often have defects in glucose homeostasis and determine how these defects impact DNL. Finally, the third approach was to test if inhibition of hepatic DNL had an impact on GNG and glucose production. &lt;/p&gt;

			The nervous system generates behavior through the coordinate activity of neural circuits. Our long&#45;term goal is to understand how sex&#45;specific behaviors are encoded by neural circuits. We are pursuing this research in the mouse, which permits a genetic, anatomic and functional analysis of sexually dimorphic behaviors in mammals. Examples of sex differences in mouse behavior include mating, aggression and nursing. Such behaviors can be observed in na&amp;iuml;ve animals without prior learning, suggesting that the underlying neural circuits are developmentally hard&#45;wired. We exploit this developmental programming to identify and manipulate neurons that influence sex&#45;specific behaviors. &lt;/p&gt;
			Sexual dimorphisms in behavior can result from sex differences in neuronal connectivity or from differences in neuronal gene expression. Either mechanism can impart sex&#45;specific electrical activity to neural circuits, leading to dimorphic behaviors. One set of projects in the lab focuses on identifying such anatomic or molecular sexual dimorphisms in the brain. Testosterone and its cognate receptor, the androgen receptor, are required for male&#45;specific behaviors. Neurons expressing the androgen receptor are likely to be responsive to testosterone and therefore to influence dimorphic behaviors. Using a genetic approach, we have labeled androgen receptor expressing neurons such that we can visualize the cell bodies as well as the processes of these neurons. This study reveals striking sexual dimorphism in androgen receptor expression in discrete brain regions, including previously identified as well as novel areas. &lt;/p&gt;
			Progesterone and estradiol are required for female&#45;specific behaviors. We are using a similar genetic approach to label neuronal subsets that express receptors for these steroids. We expect to uncover sex differences in several regions expressing these receptors, indicating areas that may influence female behaviors. Several lines of evidence suggest that estradiol signaling is required for both male&#45; and female&#45;specific behaviors. Does estradiol act on distinct brain regions to effect male&#45; and female&#45;specific behaviors? In addition, what is the nature of the epistatic interaction between testosterone&#45; and estradiol&#45; signaling in the control of male behaviors? These and related issues are the focus of developmental studies using a genetic approach. &lt;/p&gt;
			We plan to use several strategies, including microarray technology, to uncover dimorphic gene expression patterns in the brain. Such studies will highlight additional neuronal groups likely to influence dimorphic behaviors and will also enable us to use these genes as molecular tools to manipulate neurons genetically in future experiments. &lt;/p&gt;
			What is the behavioral contribution of sexual dimorphisms in the brain? We are designing genetic strategies that afford inducible and regionally restricted ablation or silencing of dimorphic neuronal subsets. In an effort to reveal the pathways in which these dimorphic neurons participate we will utilize established as well as novel genetic trans&#45;synaptic tracers. These experiments will highlight the functional relevance of neuronal dimorphisms and reveal the pathways engaged during sex&#45;specific behaviors. In mice, sex&#45;specific behaviors are regulated mainly by olfactory cues and hormonal signals. Our studies should ultimately provide an anatomic and functional link between hormonal and sensory cues and sexually dimorphic behaviors. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;b&gt;Calcium&#45;sensing and Calcium Receptors  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			My laboratory works on the signal transduction, cell biology, and biochemical properties of extracellular calcium&#45;sensing receptors (CaRs). Specifically, we are trying to understand how cells sense changes in the extracellular calcium concentration ([Ca] e ) and then respond with changes in cell function &#45;&#45; that change either rates of hormone secretion such as that of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or change cell differentiation and growth properties. &lt;/p&gt;
			We are working with cultured mouse bone marrow cells and with mouse growth plate chondrocytes in this work at present. In murine bone marrow cells, we are investigating the effects of Ca and other agonists of the CaR on the differentiation and function of cells early in the osteoblastic and osteoclastic cell lineages. To this end, we are in the process of finishing a series of studies to assess the effects of growing unfractionated bone marrow cells at different [Ca]. We are looking at changes in gene expression, protein levels for certain key osteoblastic markers, and tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and alkaline phosphatase (AP) activities. We are determining whether CaRs are expressed in unfractionated bone marrow cells and or in cells fractionated by magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) using MAbs directed against markers for bone marrow stromal cells (cells early in the osteoblastic lineage) &#45; VCAM&#45;1 (vascular cell adhesion molecule&#45;1) and for macrophage/monocyte lineage cells (CD11b). The hypothesis underlying these studies is that extracellular Ca &#45; generated via the resorption of bone matrix &#45; serves as a signal to stimulate osteoblasts and their precursors to reverse the resorptive process and stimulate bone formation. This would serve to maintain &quot;coupling&quot; between bone resorption and formation that maintain the balance of bone remodeling. &lt;/p&gt;
			To date, our studies argue strongly that high [Ca] &#45; similar to what might be generated in vivo with a potent resorptive stimulus &#45;&#45; instead of stimulating formation, increases the expression of the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) mRNA and protein. The interaction between RANKL and its receptor RANK would then promote osteoclastogenesis. We have shown that osteoclastogenesis does in fact occur in these cultures, grown at high [Ca] &#45; by demonstrating the expression of genes specific for osteoclasts (TRAP, calcitonin receptors, RANK etc) and by the presence of large/multinucleated TRAP positive cells. CaRs are also strongly expressed in the VCAM&#45;1 positive cells. &lt;/p&gt;
			These studies challenge a previously held paradigm in this area of investigation &#45;&#45; that locally generated Ca from the resorption of bone matrix serves as a locally produced &quot;coupling factor&quot; to reverse the resorptive process. Our data are more compatible with the idea that locally generated Ca, in fact, serves as part of a pathologic &quot;feed&#45;forward&quot; mechanism that could explain why pathologic bone resorption is not down&#45;regulated by local mechanisms. Studies are in progress to test the possible role of CaRs in specific bone marrow cell populations, that we will target in transgenic mice, with either dominant negative or constitutively active CaRs using available type 1 collagen or TRAP promoters. &lt;/p&gt;
			My laboratory is also assessing the role of extracellular Ca and CaRs on promoting the differentiation of cells in the growth plate in collaboration with Dr. Wenhan Chang. We have found that Ca and CaRs appear to play an important role in modulating the pace of growth plate chondrocyte differentiation in culture. Specifically low [Ca] retard and high [Ca] accelerate the expression of cartilage marker genes and the elaboration of a mature extracellular matrix. We have further found that extracellular Ca and the potent cartilage differentiation molecule PTH&#45;related protein (PTHrP) work in concert to maintain a steady pace of chondrocyte differentiation in vitro. We are further investigating the interaction between the extracellular [Ca] and the growth hormone/insulin&#45;like growth factor 1 system. High [Ca] stimulate increased expression of IGF&#45;1 and its receptor suggesting that the pro&#45;differentiation effects of high [Ca] could be modulated at least in part by the IGF&#45;1 signaling pathway. Studies are underway to understand the underlying mechanisms/ &lt;/p&gt;

			Questions of interest include cell differentiation, tissue morphogenesis and organ function. We address these questions in the zebrafish, a model system particularly amenable to embryological and genetic studies. We first identify genes critical for these processes, usually by forward genetics, and then proceed to investigate cell biological and biochemical mechanisms. Ultimately, we would like to understand developmental processes at the single cell level, both in terms of cell differentiation, cell behavior (e.g. cell migration) and intrinsic cellular properties (e.g. cell polarization). &lt;/p&gt;

			We use mouse molecular genetic, neurochemical and quantitative behavioral analysis approaches to examine the role of central serotonin systems in the regulation of complex behavioral and physiological processes. We are particularly interested in the contribution of central serotonin systems to the regulation of energy balance, patterns of physical activity and glucose homeostasis. One relevant focus of our work is on the role of 5&#45;HT2C receptors in the regulation of food intake and its interaction with the leptin system in the regulation of glucose homeostasis. We are also exploring additional links between the central serotonin system and diabetes. We are exploring similarities in the developmental programs leading to the production of mature of beta cells and serotonin neurons. Serotonin neuron&#45;specific genetic manipulations are in use to determine the extent to which these similarities reflect novel roles for serotonin systems in the coordinate regulation of feeding and substrate homeostasis, stress responses and mood. &lt;/p&gt;

			The overall goal of our research is to identify genetic defects implicated in the onset and progression of multi&#45;factorial metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes. Our strategy combines human genetic approaches with molecular biology and animal studies. We are currently concentrating our research on the molecular mechanisms implicated in the hypothalamic effects of the adipocyte&#45;secreted and weight&#45;regulating hormone leptin. After describing the first leptin receptor mutation in severely obese humans, we recently found that genetic alterations in the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R), a mediator of the hypothalamic effects of leptin, are responsible for more common forms of human obesity. Using large scale automated screening procedures we are further investigating the frequency of mutations in the MC4R gene in large cohorts of obese patients. In parallel we are also searching for obesity causing mutations in additional candidate genes downstream in the leptin pathway. Finally, both through in vitro  and in vivo studies, we are aiming to understand how these mutations cause obesity and what the implications are for the treatment of this condition. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;b&gt;Neuroendocrine Control of Reproduction and Signaling Pathways for the Antiangiogenic Factor 16K PRL  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			My laboratory works on the neuroendocrine mechanisms which control ovulation in mammals. Reproductive function is driven by the pulsatile release of the hypothalamic hormone GnRH. We showed that pulsatile release of GnRH was an intrinsic property of the GnRH neurons. We are currently studying the molecular basis for the biological clock timing the release of GnRH every 25 minutes. Current findings suggest that the clock consists of the generation of cAMP and the activation of downstream signaling pathways, including cAMP&#45;gated cation channels and protein kinase A. We use genetic approaches to alter the cAMP signaling pathway (e.g., expressing a phosphodiesterase to hydrolyze cAMP). We have now shown that lowering cAMP levels in GT1 cells or transgenic rats by expressing a phosphodiesterase results in the inhibition of pulsatile GnRH release. The lowered gonadotropin levels in the transgenic rats results in the formation of polycystic ovaries. &lt;/p&gt;
			A second research focus is to develop therapeutic agents that inhibit the formation of a new blood supply (angiogenesis) to tumors. We showed that the 16 kDa N&#45;terminal fragment of prolactin (16K PRL) is a potent anti&#45;angiogenic factor. In capillary endothelial cells, 16K PRL inhibits VEGF&#45;induced cell proliferation, activates PAI&#45;1 expression, and induces apoptosis. We are studying the signaling pathways involved in mediating these responses. We are utilizing fluorescence resonance energy transfer to understand how these complex signaling events are integrated at the level of the plasma membrane. We also showed that 16K PRL through its anti&#45;angiogenic action inhibits the growth of human colon cancer cells in a mouse model. We are now developing adenovirus vectors for testing in tumor models. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;b&gt;Thyroid Pathophysiology  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			Thyroid cancer: We are investigating re&#45;differentiation therapy in advanced thyroid cancer. Progression of follicular cell thyroid cancer is accompanied by loss of cell differentiation. As a result, advanced follicular cell thyroid cancer accumulates little if any iodine, rendering radioiodine ineffective as ablative therapy. Several common drugs have been shown to induce differentiation of thyroid cancer cells in vitro. They include retinoic acids, thiazolodinediones, and valproic acid. We recently completed a study with a retinoic acid, isotretinoin, which resulted in an increase in radioiodine uptake in 3 of 10 patients with advanced thyroid cancer. A second study with a thiazolodinedione, rosigltazone, is currently underway. A third study with valproic acid is currently being reviewed.  &lt;/p&gt;
			Subclinical hyperthyroidism : This is a state characterized by a subnormal serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in association with normal serum thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels with a prevalence of ~2%. The incidence with which subclinical hyperthyroidism progresses to overt disease is uncertain. Moreover, it is uncertain whether the incidence varies depending on the initial serum TSH value and on whether the disorder is due to Graves' disease or to multinodular goiter. Accordingly, retrospective analysis of our patients was recently undertaken. This study suggests that the natural history of subclinical hyperthyroidism is variable, resolving or occasionally evolving in Graves' disease and persisting unchanged in multinodular goiter. A prospective study is being designed to confirm and extend these observations and to identify other potential predictors of outcome. &lt;/p&gt;

			Homeostatic control of body weight depends on the ability of the brain to sense and respond to changes in peripheral energy stores. Leptin and insulin, adiposity signals that circulate in proportion to the body fat mass, enter the brain and act on specific hypothalamic neurons to inhibit food intake and increase energy expenditure. Recent evidence shows that insulin and leptin also act in the hypothalamus to regulate glucose homeostasis. Therefore, communication between leptin, insulin and key hypothalamic neurons is essential for normal energy balance and glucose homeostasis, deregulation of which will lead to obesity and type 2 diabetes. Indeed, in many forms of obesity, hypothalamic leptin and insulin resistance develops, in which leptin and insulin are less effective in causing anorexia and body weight loss. &lt;/p&gt;
			Our laboratory is interested in understanding how hypothalamic neurons sense and integrate peripheral adiposity signals such as leptin and insulin. We are currently using a combination of mouse genetic, physiologic and real time imaging approaches to address the following questions: &lt;/p&gt;
			1. What are the leptin and insulin target neurons in the hypothalamus, and what are the functions of these neurons in energy balance and glucose homeostasis? &lt;/p&gt;
			We and others have demonstrated that hypothalamic Proopiomelanocortin (Pomc) and Agouti&#45;related Protein (Agrp) expressing neurons are essential for the regulation of energy balance. Ablation of the Pomc neurons leads to profound obesity and defects in compensatory refeeding while ablation of the Agrp neurons results in severe anorexia. We are carrying out experiments to further study the function of these neurons and to identify novel targets for leptin and insulin action. &lt;/p&gt;
			2. What are the intracellular signaling mechanisms utilized by leptin in hypothalamic neurons?  &lt;/p&gt;
			We and others have illustrated that leptin signals through the Jak&#45;Stat3 and PI3K signaling pathways in key hypothalamic neurons. We are interested in further defining the functional role of each of these signaling pathways in energy balance and glucose homeostasis in specific neuronal subgroups. &lt;/p&gt;
			3. What are the mechanisms of hypothalamic leptin and insulin resistance?  &lt;/p&gt;
			Defects in intracellular signaling have been proposed to be an underlying mechanism of leptin and insulin resistance. We are using a combination of genetic and physiologic approaches to manipulate signaling events in key hypothalamic neurons in order to understand how leptin and insulin resistance develops and if perturbation of leptin and insulin signaling leads to obesity and type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;

			We study the activity of the intracellular receptors (IRs) in signal transduction and transcriptional control, including receptors for glucocorticoids (GR), androgens (AR), and thyroid hormone (TR).These hormone&#45;receptor complexes bind to specific DNA sequences termed hormone response elements, which enhance or repress linked promoters. &lt;/p&gt;
			We have defined IR domains for hormone and DNA binding, dimerization, nuclear localization, phosphorylation, interaction with various cellular factors and transcriptional regulation. IRs function faithfully when expressed in simpler organisms such as yeast and Drosophila, thus facilitating genetic analyses of their actions and identification of other factors involved in their activities. We are also pursuing 3D&#45;structure analyses of various domains of the receptor, and we employ biochemical strategies with purified components for mechanistic analyses. Thus, using genetic, structural, molecular and biochemical approaches, we use IRs as biological probes to define how a single regulatory protein can specify diverse patterns of specific gene expression in different cellular contexts. &lt;/p&gt;
			These strategies can increasingly be applied to studies of complex physiological and pathological processes. Thus, we are pursuing: (a) a signaling crosstalk pathway in developing T&#45;cells in which activation of the T&#45;cell receptor abrogates glucocorticoid&#45;induced apoptosis; (b) dramatic shifts in AR activity and ligand responses during prostate cancer ontogeny and progression; (c) the consequences of glutamine repeat expansion in AR, leading to motor neuron degeneration in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy. &lt;/p&gt;
