			&lt;h2&gt;Illness As a Teacher&lt;/h2&gt;

			&quot;/&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;By Sima Pendharkar, MD, ACP Associate Member&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Fresh out of residency on my first night shift as a hospitalist, I was wide awake and bright&#45;eyed—running on a healthy dose of adrenaline, ready to take on anything. Having tackled admissions, cross&#45;cover and everything in between, I sat perched over my computer by 3 a.m., eager to complete all the night’s documentation. In my Zen&#45;like zone, I began typing but was soon jarred by the buzzing of my pager. It was a fretful nurse requesting my immediate presence at a patient’s bedside.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Standing outside the patient's room, I quickly glanced at the cross&#45;cover notes. He was a 47&#45;year&#45;old homeless man with AIDS who was admitted for pneumocystis pneumonia, now on hospital day 12.  Before I entered, the nurse told me the patient was extremely angry, was demanding to have his oxygen removed, and wanted to leave the hospital against medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;With that information in hand, I eagerly entered the room. I felt quite confident I could use my compassion, medical knowledge and general wit to bring some comfort and calm at this odd hour.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;When I started to introduce myself, I was interrupted by Mr. P’s harsh, sharp voice and cutting eyes, which dissected my every motion as I made my way towards him. I immediately recognized the weathering effect the physical elements had placed upon him—long beard, scattered tattoos, missing teeth—and I was struck by his fighting spirit. I pulled up a chair to listen to his concerns, though I was not a welcome visitor that night.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;img class=&quot;imgRight&quot; src=&quot;/sites/zsfghospitalmedicine.ucsf.edu/files/images/sima_pendharkar.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot;/&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;In the following days, Mr. P's condition began to rapidly deteriorate. He became increasingly hypoxemic, continued to lose weight and—most concerning—the feisty sparkle in his eyes began to dissipate. He initially attempted to protest his body’s deteriorating state by refusing to eat and by sprinkling snide remarks into every conversation. Reasoning with him was next to impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;One afternoon, as I explained to him the current therapeutic dilemmas and the very real prospect of his mortality, tears rolled down his hollow cheeks. Despite the tough external facade, Mr. P’s emotional walls were crumbling and he was starting to open up. There was now room for dialogue and emotional honesty where before that wasn’t the case. As I reached towards him to comfort him, he looked me in the eye and said, “I’m scared.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Over the weeks of his hospital stay, I had the opportunity to know Mr. P not only as a patient but as a friend, a dreamer, a fighter and a witty, compassionate individual. As the illness experience enveloped him, I witnessed his beautiful metamorphosis to a state of higher insight and peacefulness about his own health.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;He made a miraculous recovery. His physical body regained strength, but more surprising was that he seemed overcome with a general sense of peace, contentment and lightness. While he looked forward to getting back to his tent under one of the highway bridges, he was also contemplating taking some classes and considering how he could use this life&#45;altering experience to help others.  &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Sometimes when I’m driving under various bridges around the city and spot pockets of homeless people, I find myself wondering about Mr. P. I hope the new vista that his mind and body have offered up will give him the strength and courage to embark on many more of life’s adventures.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Facts on homelessness&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;On a single night, 643,067 individuals in the U.S. were homeless, according to the 2009 Annual Homeless Assessment Report by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;63% of homeless individuals were sheltered and 37% were unsheltered, according to the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;In 2003, children younger than 18 comprised 39% of the homeless population. Of those, 42% were under the age of five, according to the National Coalition for the Homeless (NCH).&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Among surveyed sheltered homeless persons, roughly 26% have severe mental illness according to the NCH. In addition, 38% reported alcohol problems and 26% reported addictions to other drugs.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;In 22 cities surveyed, 15% of homeless persons reported they were victims of domestic violence, according to the U.S. Conference of Mayors' Status Report on Hunger and Homelessness in America's Cities: 2008.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;
			San Francisco General Hospital is seeking exceptional candidates to join its Hospital Medicine Group. This group of physicians includes general medicine internists, family physicians, and faculty sub&#45;specialty trained in geriatrics, palliative care, rheumatology and infectious disease. 
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Successful candidates will have strong academic clinical training in Internal Medicine or Family Medicine and demonstrate outstanding collaborative and instructional skills. All faculty will hold appointments at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) at the Assistant or Associate Clinical Professor level in the Department of Medicine or Family and Community Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/zsfghospitalmedicine.ucsf.edu/files/images/phone_fun.png&quot; class=&quot;imgRight&quot;/&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;SFGH is the only trauma center and the only public hospital in San Francisco, serving as the referral center for the Department of Public Health network of 13 clinics. Serving a city that is an international hub, SFGH cares for patients that travel and immigrate from countries from all over the globe. Each day, SFGH has in&#45;house interpreters who support care in over 30 languages. SFGH is an acknowledged leader in innovative programs for HIV care, tuberculosis control, chemical dependency, cultural contributors to mental health, and health literacy and language access in medical care.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Beloved by the city for its abiding commitment to provide care to all of San Francisco, SFGH has been called the &quot;Heart of the City.&quot; The depth of the city's support for SFGH is exemplified by the 84% voter approval for the bond to fund the construction of a new hospital set to open in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;SFGH is staffed by the UCSF School of Medicine, along with the UCSF Schools of Nursing, Dentistry, and Pharmacy. UCSF has been the City's partner for providing patient care since 1873. Today, some 1,600 UCSF physicians, specialty nurses, health care professionals and other professionals work side&#45;by&#45;side with City employees at SFGH. On any given day, about one&#45;third of all UCSF medical students, residents and fellows are working and training at SFGH.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h4&gt;Position Responsibilites&lt;/h4&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;New faculty members will join an environment designed to support excellence in patient&#45;centered, cost&#45;effective, outstanding clinical care; advancing leadership in innovative training programs; and establishing prominent roles designing and leading systems change for the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The position will entail inpatient clinical work involving a combination of the following: &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Attending on a faculty service independent of house staff involvement.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Attending on the house staff&#45;covered adult medical ward teams.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Attending on a faculty service that provides co&#45;management services to patients with primarily orthopedic surgical problems.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Medicine consultation service.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;We intend to have in&#45;house attending supervision of house staff teams, so anticipate an equitable distribution of day and night shifts among faculty. We are open to hiring faculty who are interested in predominantly night time clinical work. &lt;/p&gt;

			margin&#45;right:10px;&quot;/&gt;
			
			&lt;h4&gt;Other non&#45;clinical opportunities to improve care for patients:&lt;/h4&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;With 35% of UCSF's trainees on campus on any given day, there are numerous opportunities to teach and develop education innovations.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The specific amount and nature of the clinical and non&#45;clinical responsibilities will be influenced by the interests of the candidate and the identified needs of the medical center. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;We encourage candidates with diverse backgrounds and training and interests to apply. UCSF is an equal opportunity employer committed to excellence through diversity. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Interested candidates should email a cover letter, resume/CV and contact information for 3&#45;4 references to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:DHMrecruitment@medsfgh.ucsf.edu&quot;&gt;DHMrecruitment@medsfgh.ucsf.edu.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;SFGH is in a period of remarkable growth and change. We welcome candidates who are enthusiastic about contributing to re&#45;shaping care at SFGH as we look forward to carrying a culture of compassion and excellence into our new hospital in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

Community Care Transitions Project ./hospital/research/cctp_trans.html

		<Tax>1736</Tax>
		<Path>./hospital/research/cctp_trans.html</Path>
		<FileBody>
			
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
			Care transitions occur when a patient moves from one health care provider or setting to another. Nearly one in five Medicare patients discharged from a hospital—approximately 2.6 million seniors—is readmitted within 30 days, at a cost of over $26 billion every year. Hospitals have traditionally served as the focal point of efforts to reduce readmissions by focusing on those components that they are directly responsible for, including the quality of care during the hospitalization and the discharge planning process. However, it is clear that there are multiple factors along the care continuum that impact readmissions, and identifying the key drivers of readmissions for a hospital and its downstream providers is the first step towards implementing the appropriate interventions necessary for reducing readmissions. The Community Care Transitions Project (CCTP) seeks to correct these deficiencies by encouraging a community to come together and work together to improve quality, reduce cost, and improve patient experience. The CCTP is part of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.innovations.cms.gov/initiatives/Partnership&#45;for&#45;Patients/index.html&quot;&gt;Partnership for Patients&lt;/a&gt;, a nationwide public&#45;private partnership that aims to reduce preventative errors in hospitals by 40 percent and reduce hospital readmissions by 20 percent.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
			Excerpt taken from: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.innovations.cms.gov/initiatives/Partnership&#45;for&#45;Patients/CCTP/index.html?itemID=CMS1239313&quot;&gt;Center for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Innovation.&lt;/a&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h2&gt;San Francisco Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
			As of October 2012, 47 organizations have been selected to participate. San Francisco was selected in Round 3, announced this past August. The San Francisco Transitional Care Program, led by the Department of Aging and Adult Services, will utilize health care coaches and care managers working for local Community Based Organizations (CBO’s) to effectively manage Medicare patients' transitions and improve their quality of care. The CBO’s will be paid an all&#45;inclusive rate per eligible discharge by CMS, based on the cost of care transition services provided at the patient level and of implementing systemic changes at the hospital level. CBOs will only be paid once per eligible discharge in a 180&#45;day period of time for any given beneficiary.  San Francisco General Hospital has played a large role in the planning and implementation process. Michelle Schneidermann sits on the governing board and Sharon Kwong, Director of Social Services at SFGH, sits on the steering committee.

		<FileBody>
			
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;UCSF, Baystate Medical Center, and the University of Pennsylvania are leading the development of a new quality and safety focused network &#45; the Hospital Medicine Reengineering Network (HOMERUN) &#45; that aims to improve outcomes of patients on general medical wards. HOMERUN will draw on the experience of the Vermont&#45;Oxford Neonatal Network and National Surgical Quality Improvement Projects (among others), and leverage the growth of hospitalists to help speed improvement in care across participating sites&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;h3&gt;What is HOMERUN?&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;HOMERUN is a collaborative quality improvement and implementation research network focused on three key missions:&lt;/p&gt;
			
				&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;To use measures that matter to hospitalizes and their patients to improve quality and efficiency of care in the hospital and afterwards.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;To link improvement efforts to robust and timely evaluation, so that the pace of meaningful improvement is accelerated.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;To study how to ensure the uptake of effective improvements through implementation science.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;These missions are possible because HOMERUN includes sites which represent national leaders in hospital medicine, care improvement methods and implementation science, as well as expertise in specific topic areas relevant to hospital medicine (e.g. thromboembolism prevention, readmission reduction, medication reconciliation, infection reduction).&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Rationale for HOMERUN&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Medical patients are the largest patient group in US hospitals, and more than half of these patients are cared for by hospitalists.  As a result, hospitalists are the most important potential stakeholders in innovations which seek to improve the care of general medical patients.   However, despite the importance of this group of doctors and patients, remarkably little attention has been given to them. In particular:&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;ol&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Existing benchmarking approaches often focus on methodologies that are based on the lowest common denominator of available data (e.g., ICD codes).  Benchmarking using only these data do not engage front line providers, and compel change slowly. In addition, benchmarking using these data do not explicitly collect data of importance to patients (such as functional status, or understanding of a care plan).&lt;/li&gt;
				
				&lt;li&gt;Many publicly reported measures (e.g., Joint Commission quality measures for pneumonia) are actually geared toward emergency department care or the ICU. A hospital seeking to implement evidence&#45;based practices on their medical wards currently has a very limited ability to support improvement in care transitions, reduction in venous thromboembolism, or reduction in hospital&#45;acquired infections.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ol&gt;

			&lt;img class=&quot;shhe_logo&quot; src=&quot;/sites/zsfghospitalmedicine.ucsf.edu/files/images/shhe_logo.png&quot; width=&quot;100&quot;/&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Support from Hospital to Home for Elders (SHHE) Project: A 700 person randomized controlled study led by co&#45;investigators Jeff Critchfield, MD and Sue Currin, RN, MS.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
			The Support from Hospital to Home for Elders (SHHE) Study is a clinical trial that is assessing the impact of discharge interventions in SFGH’s ethnically and culturally diverse safety net setting.  The Study, generously funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, is a hybrid of principles from Project RED, the Care Transitions Intervention, and patient&#45;centered methodologies.  It is the first transitions intervention randomized control trial to target English, Spanish, and Chinese&#45;speaking patients over the age of 55 with language and culturally concordant one&#45;on&#45;one nursing interventions. Patients admitted to SFGH are assigned to work with one of a diverse team of nurses that reflect the cultural and language diversity of the target population. This “transitionalist” nurse then shepherds the patient and their family members through the process of preparing for the transition home and into the care of their primary care provider/medical home.  
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
			In the role of transitionalist, the nurses have three primary functions. The first is as patient and care&#45;giver coach, engaging and activating patients and care&#45;givers through motivational interviewing techniques and goal setting to help ready them for the self&#45;care and care navigation challenges after discharge.  The second function is as educator, using a combination of teach&#45;back and traditional bedside teaching techniques to help patients understand their diagnoses, medications, and post&#45;discharge care plan.  The third function is to promote coordination through medication reconciliation and assistance with post&#45;discharge follow&#45;up plans.  Nurses communicate with the patients’ outpatient providers to help facilitate the hand&#45;off from hospital to medical home.  After discharge, the nurses call the patient and caregivers at home to check in about medications, symptoms, function, and follow&#45;up and utilize coaching techniques to assist the patient and caregiver to make healthy choices.  If urgent interventions around medications or service needs are identified during the phone call, the nurses consult with inpatient and ambulatory providers to come up with a safe and appropriate plan of care.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
			The SHHE team has enrolled 700 patients.   The results will be analyzed and published sometime in the next year comparing outcomes between the intervention and usual care groups.  In the meantime, the intervention has been widely accepted by hospital leadership and front&#45;line staff and is being embedded into the routine transitional care. As CMS begins to fund more options for transitional care such as the Community Care Transitions Project, the hope is that the SHHE Project will become part of a menu of culturally and language appropriate interventions available to SFGH patients.

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;The Acute Care for Elders (ACE) at the San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center (SFGH) is an interdisciplinary model of care for hospitalized older adults with a focus on maintaining and improving physical function and returning patients to a community setting.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The essential elements of ACE are:&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;ol&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Patient centered care, with early identification of the patient’s goals of care.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Prepared environment to promote independent function. This includes dedicated staff to promote early ambulation and physical activity and a community dining room.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Interdisciplinary team approach to care. The ACE teams consist of bedside nurses, ACE nursing assistants, a rehabilitation specialist, a dietitian, a pharmacist, a CNS/NP, a social worker, and Geriatricians. This team is focused on ensuring safe, appropriate, effective, timely care that is consistent with each patient’s individual goals.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Early discharge planning.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Medication review, with an emphasis on non&#45;pharmacologic approaches to symptom management and avoiding polypharmacy.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ol&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The ACE teams rounds daily and provide care recommendations to the primary admitting services. In addition, all staff have attended a 3&#45;day Geriatrics Resource Nurse training session emphasizing skills needed to promote functional independence and avoid hazards commonly associated with hospitalization in older adults. The ACE units were started in February, 2007 and are located on 5C and 5D. The 22 ACE Unit beds are open to all medical and surgical services.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;The Medical Consultation Service at San Francisco General Hospital evaluates and treats patients with medical problems who are hospitalized on non&#45;medical services.  The Service is staffed by an attending physician who also supervises a third&#45;year internal medicine resident.  Our attending physicians come from both the Division of General Internal Medicine (DGIM) and from the Division of Hospital Medicine (DHM) and have extensive experience with the medical issues that commonly arise in hospitalized patients.  We are available 24&#45;hours a day, 7&#45;days a week for assistance.  Additionally, we make recommendations regarding perioperative risk reduction for patients requiring surgery or other invasive procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;At SFGH, the Medical Consultation Service focuses on a number of important objectives, including but not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Providing outstanding, evidence&#45;based care for patients.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Improving transitions of care for patients from the inpatient to the outpatient setting.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Improving communication with patients’ primary care providers.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Improving communication and interaction among medical and non&#45;medical services.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Providing residents with a top&#45;tier education in medical consultation and perioperative medicine.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Please contact us at 443&#45;7246 to request a consult, or contact the Director of the service, &lt;a href=&quot;/faculty/?key=f5f4dc1e698fdc25f885d4be85f31bfe&amp;name=BROOKS%2CRICHARD+BENJAMIN&quot;&gt;Dr. Richard Brooks &lt;/a&gt;with any questions or concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;hr&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;By Sima Pendharkar, MD, ACP Associate Member&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Fresh out of residency on my first night shift as a hospitalist, I was wide awake and bright&#45;eyed—running on a healthy dose of adrenaline, ready to take on anything. Having tackled admissions, cross&#45;cover and everything in between, I sat perched over my computer by 3 a.m., eager to complete all the night’s documentation. In my Zen&#45;like zone, I began typing but was soon jarred by the buzzing of my pager. It was a fretful nurse requesting my immediate presence at a patient’s bedside.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Standing outside the patient's room, I quickly glanced at the cross&#45;cover notes. He was a 47&#45;year&#45;old homeless man with AIDS who was admitted for pneumocystis pneumonia, now on hospital day 12.  Before I entered, the nurse told me the patient was extremely angry, was demanding to have his oxygen removed, and wanted to leave the hospital against medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;With that information in hand, I eagerly entered the room. I felt quite confident I could use my compassion, medical knowledge and general wit to bring some comfort and calm at this odd hour.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;When I started to introduce myself, I was interrupted by Mr. P’s harsh, sharp voice and cutting eyes, which dissected my every motion as I made my way towards him. I immediately recognized the weathering effect the physical elements had placed upon him—long beard, scattered tattoos, missing teeth—and I was struck by his fighting spirit. I pulled up a chair to listen to his concerns, though I was not a welcome visitor that night.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;img class=&quot;imgRight&quot; src=&quot;/sites/zsfghospitalmedicine.ucsf.edu/files/images/sima_pendharkar.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot;/&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;In the following days, Mr. P's condition began to rapidly deteriorate. He became increasingly hypoxemic, continued to lose weight and—most concerning—the feisty sparkle in his eyes began to dissipate. He initially attempted to protest his body’s deteriorating state by refusing to eat and by sprinkling snide remarks into every conversation. Reasoning with him was next to impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;One afternoon, as I explained to him the current therapeutic dilemmas and the very real prospect of his mortality, tears rolled down his hollow cheeks. Despite the tough external facade, Mr. P’s emotional walls were crumbling and he was starting to open up. There was now room for dialogue and emotional honesty where before that wasn’t the case. As I reached towards him to comfort him, he looked me in the eye and said, “I’m scared.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Over the weeks of his hospital stay, I had the opportunity to know Mr. P not only as a patient but as a friend, a dreamer, a fighter and a witty, compassionate individual. As the illness experience enveloped him, I witnessed his beautiful metamorphosis to a state of higher insight and peacefulness about his own health.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;He made a miraculous recovery. His physical body regained strength, but more surprising was that he seemed overcome with a general sense of peace, contentment and lightness. While he looked forward to getting back to his tent under one of the highway bridges, he was also contemplating taking some classes and considering how he could use this life&#45;altering experience to help others.  &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Sometimes when I’m driving under various bridges around the city and spot pockets of homeless people, I find myself wondering about Mr. P. I hope the new vista that his mind and body have offered up will give him the strength and courage to embark on many more of life’s adventures.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Facts on homelessness&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;On a single night, 643,067 individuals in the U.S. were homeless, according to the 2009 Annual Homeless Assessment Report by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;63% of homeless individuals were sheltered and 37% were unsheltered, according to the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;In 2003, children younger than 18 comprised 39% of the homeless population. Of those, 42% were under the age of five, according to the National Coalition for the Homeless (NCH).&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Among surveyed sheltered homeless persons, roughly 26% have severe mental illness according to the NCH. In addition, 38% reported alcohol problems and 26% reported addictions to other drugs.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;In 22 cities surveyed, 15% of homeless persons reported they were victims of domestic violence, according to the U.S. Conference of Mayors' Status Report on Hunger and Homelessness in America's Cities: 2008.&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;The Faculty Inpatient Service (FIS) at San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH) is comprised of nine full&#45;time hospitalists, several part&#45;time hospitalists, and one nurse practitioner.  Together these providers, who operate the service 24&#45;hours per day, seven days per week, care for approximately one&#45;third of the patients on the Medicine Service at SFGH and act as the primary inpatient providers for a group of patients with Orthopedic surgical problems who also have complex medical needs. In addition to caring for these patients, the FIS plays an important role in staffing the Medicine Consultation service at various times throughout the week, and they offer invaluable supervision and teaching for our Internal Medicine residents overnight.  While the primary role of the FIS is to provide clinical care of patients, they are also essential members of several interdisciplinary teams working to improve the quality and safety of patient care at SFGH.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;To continue to deliver on SFGH’s mission to provide quality health care and trauma services with compassion and respect for patients of all cultures and backgrounds, we have instituted a co&#45;management service between Medicine and Orthopedics departments. The team is called the “Faculty Inpatient Service&#45;Green Team”. This “Green Team” is designed to care for those hospitalized patients who need urgent/emergent orthopedic services but who also have very complicated past medical histories or acute medical problems via a dedicated team of internal medicine hospitalist working closely in conjunction with orthopedic subspecialist, physical therapists, and nurse practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;li&gt;Improve quality and safety of patient care&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Improve communication between health care teams&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Deliver the highest standard of care to our patients&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Enhance the educational environment&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Develop efficient and expertly managed care delivery to provide our patients optimal chances for healing and wellness recovery after their injury&lt;/li&gt;

						&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Hundreds of patients are admitted to San Francisco General Hospital &amp; Trauma Center every month with life&#45;threatening conditions, either due to an acute injury or progression of an advanced, chronic illness.  These patients, as well as their families and caregivers, often face difficult decisions regarding their care, and sometimes struggle with distressing symptoms like pain, shortness of breath, or anxiety regarding what lies ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;San Francisco General Hospital’s &lt;b&gt;Supportive &amp; Palliative Care Service&lt;/b&gt; is an interdisciplinary team of providers that helps support patients with advanced or life&#45;limiting illnesses, as well as their families and caregivers.  Whether patients are alone or surrounded by family and friends, this Service seeks to ease physical symptoms, but also to provide comprehensive care that addresses the emotional and spiritual distress that sometimes accompanies a life&#45;threatening illness.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Care is provided through a unique team of providers, which includes physicians, nurses, social workers, and chaplains.  &lt;a href=&quot;/services/palliative/team.html&quot;&gt;Meet the team&lt;/a&gt;. We also work closely with hospital staff to improve patients’ quality of life, by requesting consultation from pharmacists, nutritionists, respiratory therapists, and occupational and physical therapists. When it is time for patients to leave the hospital, we work closely with community partners and home care agencies to provide a smooth transition either to the patient's home or to an extended care facility.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The Supportive &amp; Palliative Care Service provides care in all areas of the hospital, from the emergency room to the medical/surgical units and intensive care units.  For patients who may die in the hospital, the Service provides intensive symptom management, opportunities for reflection and meaningful connections with friends and family, and visits from spiritual leaders, if desired.  This specialized care is often provided in two converted patient rooms known as “&lt;a href=&quot;/services/palliative/comfort.html&quot;&gt;Comfort Care Suites&lt;/a&gt; ,” which create a more peaceful, home&#45;like environment, accommodating visitors who wish to stay with their loved ones in the final hours of life.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;These services are made possible through the City &amp; County of San Francisco, grant funding from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chcf.org/&quot;&gt;California HealthCare Foundation&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfghf.net/index.html&quot;&gt;San Francisco General Hospital Foundation &lt;/a&gt;, as well as generous philanthropic support from individual donors.

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;The Resident Inpatient Service (RIS) at San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH) cares for a broad range of patients who require Medicine inpatient care at the ward or step&#45;down level.  The service consists of five Medicine teams, each with an attending, a senior resident, two interns, and typically, one fourth&#45;year medical student and one or two third&#45;year medical students.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;imgLeft&quot; src=&quot;/sites/zsfghospitalmedicine.ucsf.edu/files/images/resident_doctalk.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Members of the Division of Hospital Medicine provide just over one&#45;third of the attending support for the RIS, which cares for about two&#45;thirds of the patients admitted to Medicine (excluding Medical ICU and Cardiology).  The primary responsibility of the Medicine attending is to provide active oversight of patient care.  However, the attending also plays a critical role in the clinical education of Medicine house staff and medical students, both through rounds and bedside teaching and via scheduled time for didactics.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;img class=&quot;imgRight&quot; src=&quot;/sites/zsfghospitalmedicine.ucsf.edu/files/images/respite_plants.png&quot;/&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Reducing preventable hospital readmission—especially among frequent users—is important for health care systems. New health care reform legislation further places attention on readmissions, and provides incen tives for systems of care that examine and demonstrate innovative and effective practices that reduce hospitalization among frequent users. Homeless populations suffer disproportionately high rates of chronic and infectious disease, mental illness, and substance use&#45;related health problems. Homelessness is consistently associated with longer and repeated hospital stays and homeless individuals are disproportionately represented among frequent users of hospital care. Among people who are homeless, competing priorities, barriers to routine medical care, and challenges with medication adherence all represent risk factors for hospital use. In addition, post&#45;discharge patients often return to environments that are sub&#45;optimal for healing, and may face difficulty with medication management, routine follow&#45;up, and adherence to after&#45;care plans that increase likelihood of re&#45;hospitalization. Medical Respite programs provide an alternative to street discharge for homeless patients. The Medical Respite model addresses specific needs of homeless patients by providing temporary housing and post&#45;acute medical care for those who are too ill or frail to recover from a physical illness or injury on the streets, but are not ill enough to be in a hospital. To date, over 57 Medical Respite programs have been established in U.S. cities. While the capacity and level of service provision varies among these programs, they uniformly provide a safe and clean environment appropriate for healing and access to nursing and medical staff to assist patients with routine aftercare, wound care and medication support.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;imgLeft&quot; src=&quot;/sites/zsfghospitalmedicine.ucsf.edu/files/images/outside_respite.png&quot;/&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Effective strategies to reduce re&#45;hospitalization include consistent patient education and seamless transition to community medical care. At Medical Respite these strategies are tailored to serve homeless patients who may not have a history of successful engagement with community based services. A recent review of Respite models across the U.S. noted that Medical Respite presents a critical window to engage homeless patients and make connections to community based medical care, social services and housing that can help patients continue successful transition. Among homeless populations, routine primary care, substance abuse treatment, and entrance into supported housing programs have all been shown to have independent, positive effects on likelihood of hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/zsfghospitalmedicine.ucsf.edu/files/images/group_respite.png&quot; class=&quot;imgRight&quot; width=&quot;250px&quot;/&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The San Francisco Medical Respite is a 45&#45;bed residential facility in downtown San Francisco, established in 2007 by the San Francisco Department of Public Health Housing and Urban Health Department (SFDPH). San Francisco Medical Respite accepts patient referrals from the city’s public hospital, San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH), the Veteran’s Administration Hospital, University of California and San Francisco (UCSF) Medical Center, and seven private community hospitals. As in other cities, homeless patients in San Francisco are disproportionately represented among high users of medical services, and SFGH staff estimate that up to 20% of inpatients are homeless on any given night. Due to the high number of homeless inpatients, Respite referrals are often triaged by both referring providers and Medical Respite staff. As a result, Respite serves patients who are among the most medically complicated, who are typically triply diagnosed (medical, psychiatric, and substance use) and who have multiple chronic medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p&gt;Onsite Respite medical staff (seven days a week and 24 hours on call) include registered and advance practice nurses, physicians and physician assistants, and medical assistants who, as a team, provide urgent and intermediate care, health education services, and referrals to primary and specialty care in the community. Community health workers provide support services as well as case management, under the supervision of social workers. Social workers individually assess all patients, and assist patients obtaining government issued identification, income benefits (such as Social Security Disability Insurance) and medical coverage (Medi&#45;Cal or Medicaid). Where appropriate, social workers also assist patients in applying for supported housing (SFDPH also administers a supported housing program: Direct Access to Housing). Respite staff continue to follow up with patients throughout their medical treatment and discharge planning to make appropriate referrals and assist with patient appointments as needed. Discharge plans are reviewed by multi&#45;disciplinary teams with an eye toward ensuring both that patients are medically ready for discharge and that referrals and follow up services are sufficiently in place to promote success in the community.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;The final hours and days of life can be a time of physical, emotional, and spiritual stress for both patients and families.  While some choose or hope to spend this time in their homes, others remain at San Francisco General during their last days.  In December 2010, San Francisco General Hospital opened a 2&#45;bed Palliative Care Unit, known as the &quot;Comfort Care Suites,&quot; located on the Oncology/HIV Unit.  Patients receive expert symptom management and families are supported by an interdisciplinary team of providers, providing sensitive care in a more home&#45;like environment than is usually found in a hospital room.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/zsfghospitalmedicine.ucsf.edu/files/images/funded_unit.png&quot; class=&quot;imgLeft&quot;/&gt;
			
			&lt;p class=&quot;unit_notation&quot;&gt;This specialized unit was made possible through a combination of donations and funding from the City and County of San Francisco, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfghf.net&quot;&gt;San Francisco General Hospital Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, and a local non&#45;profit organization, &lt;a href=&quot;http://healingenvironments.org/&quot;&gt;Healing Environments&lt;/a&gt;.  Through these collaborations and important donations, ordinary hospital rooms were transformed into more comfortable, home&#45;like spaces in which family members can hold vigil with their loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;

She volunteered for youth&#45;serving agencies in San Francisco, and for the SF Department of Public Health, providing HIV education in public, parochial and private schools. From there, she co&#45;founded an HIV organization called Bay Area Young (BAY) Positives providing psychosocial support to HIV+ youth. This led her to work for the Shanti Project, where she developed programs and provided care coordination to underserved people with HIV/AIDS and breast cancer. It was through this work, interfacing with the healthcare system, that she became inspired to become a nurse and continue her passion for serving the most underserved people in San Francisco. Throughout her nursing career, she has worked on the HIV/AIDS&#45;Oncology unit at SFGH caring for many patients at end&#45;of&#45;life, which galvanized her passion for the field of Palliative Care.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Many of our patients do not have visitors during the day, either because family members live far away, or are unable to take time away from work or other responsibilities.  As a result, many patients must face difficult, life&#45;threatening conditions by themselves.  Volunteers help to provide important companionship and support for these individuals, bringing dignity and relief through attentive listening and companionship&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/zsfghospitalmedicine.ucsf.edu/files/images/hands.png&quot; style=&quot;padding:40px;&quot;/&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;What roles do volunteers play?&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;There are many different ways to support patient care, and the Palliative Care Program Director would be pleased to help you find ways to serve that are meaningful and comfortable for you.  Some of the possible roles include:&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Visiting patients (for example, engaging them in conversation, reading to them, playing music, or just sitting silently with them)&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Assisting patients in life review exercises (recording stories, writing letters, making phone calls, creating artwork)&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Taking patients for a walk (or brief trips out of their rooms)&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Bringing patients food, personal care items, art supplies, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Working on the palliative care program database&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Assisting with graphic design projects (such as formatting patient and family educational materials)&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Assisting with program website design and maintenance&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Is there specific training or skills required to volunteer with SPCS?&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Your training requirements will depend on your interests, and what tasks or projects you would like to do.  For volunteers interested in visiting patients, hospital orientation and screening will be required.  For those interested in administrative/program development projects, training in health information &amp; patient privacy will be required.  We do not require personal experience or training in caring for people with advanced illness; however, all volunteers should be courteous, respectful, and sensitive to our particular patient population, many of whom are facing the end of their lives with little social or emotional support.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;What times can I volunteer?&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Volunteers are usually asked to commit to a minimum of 100 hours of service over 1&#45;2 years.  Individuals can participate in 4&#45;hour shifts (morning or evening), Monday through Friday, year&#45;round.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;How can I apply to volunteer?&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Contact the Volunteer Services Department at San Francisco General Hospital by calling 415&#45;206&#45;8193.&lt;/p&gt;
