			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Cardiovascular disease remains the nation’s leading cause of death, and UCSF is a pioneer in developing better ways to diagnose, treat and prevent heart disease. Our mission is to provide the best possible care to all patients with cardiovascular disease, make important discoveries that benefit patients and offer the best training for cardiology and subspecialty fellows. &lt;/p&gt; 
			
			&lt;p&gt;UCSF has three Divisions of Cardiology, located at  &lt;a href=&quot;/about/campuses.html&quot;&gt;UCSF Medical Center at Parnassus/Mount Zion/Mission Bay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/about/campuses.html&quot;&gt;San Francisco General Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;/about/campuses.html&quot;&gt;San Francisco VA Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;We use the most advanced tools to diagnose cardiovascular disease, and our physicians include world&#45;renowned experts in every area of cardiology. We not only treat heart disease – ranging from routine diseases to the most complex and rare – we work to prevent heart disease. We have a wide range of clinical services and expertise, and deliver quality care with compassion and a patient&#45;centered focus.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Our experts are available to provide consultation for all aspects of cardiovascular care and prevention. We strive to provide rapid, seamless referrals, and our new electronic medical record allows for rapid communication of findings and follow&#45;up.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;We also conduct a wide range of research at all campuses, discovering more about everything from causes of heart disease to which new drugs and devices are most likely to benefit patients.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;We have one of the most prestigious cardiology training programs in the country, and routinely receive more than 400 applications for half a dozen fellowship positions each year. Our cardiology fellows are mentored by our world&#45;class faculty, and have the unparalleled opportunity to conduct research and care for diverse populations of patients at all campus sites.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Thank you for visiting our website. We invite you to learn more about our programs, and look forward to partnering with you in advancing our missions of patient care, discovery and medical education.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;The Comprehensive Amyloid Center at the University of California San Francisco provides a multidisciplinary patient&#45;centered, state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art approach for the care of each patient. Our dedicated team is comprised of experts from various disciplines, including Hematology, Cardiology, Nephrology, Neurology, Radiology, and Pathology, among others. Our team members work closely in order to ensure exceptional care for patients with all forms of amyloidosis.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The Comprehensive Amyloid Center facilitates awareness, education and training of physicians in the field of amyloidosis. In addition, our center promotes research endeavors through institutional, national and international collaboration. Our basic research investigates the mechanisms for the development of amyloid at transcriptional and post&#45;transcriptional levels, while our translational research strives to develop novel therapies for amyloidosis. Finally, our clinical research includes national and international trials of therapeutic agents for various types of amyloidosis. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Our center serves as a resource for the support of patients, family members, and caregivers.

			&lt;h3&gt;Patient Profile: Peter Stremmel &#45; The Art of Gratitude&lt;/h3&gt;

			Peter Stremmel with wife Turkey Stremmel cheering on their favorite team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
			
			In 2008, Peter Stremmel, then 58, had a treadmill cardiac stress test showing abnormalities his doctor couldn't quite explain. However, Mr. Stremmel – who runs a contemporary art gallery in Reno, NV with his wife, Turkey – felt fine, so his doctor continued to monitor him.
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			A few years later, Mr. Stremmel began to feel short of breath. After more tests, both in Reno and Sacramento, he was diagnosed as having hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. He was treated for this condition, but his symptoms worsened steadily.
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			&quot;It was alarming enough that I said, ‘I want to get this properly checked out,' said Mr. Stremmel. A close friend suggested that he see Dr. William Grossman, the Charles and Helen Schwab Endowed Chair in Preventive Cardiology. Mr. Stremmel came to UCSF and received several examinations and more tests from Dr. Grossman, who suspected that he did not have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
			 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Dr. Grossman sent him to Dr. Liviu Klein, a heart failure specialist at UCSF, for a heart catheterization and biopsy. The biopsy showed that Mr. Stremmel had cardiac amyloidosis, in which a protein called amyloid is deposited within the heart muscle, causing progressive heart failure. Of Dr. Klein, Mr. Stremmel said, &quot;He is a real sweetheart, and explained that the type of amyloidosis I had was sometimes very slow&#45;moving,&quot; recalled Mr. Stremmel. 
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Over time, however, Mr. Stremmel noticed increased shortness of breath when climbing stairs. Dr. Grossman asked him to come in for an appointment. &quot;His bedside manner was so good,&quot; said Mr. Stremmel. &quot;He said, ‘Pete, the condition is progressing faster than we had hoped. I think you definitely need a heart transplant.' I had been mentally preparing myself for this, and said, ‘Why didn't you tell me this over the phone?' Dr. Grossman said, ‘This isn't the kind of news I want to give over the phone.'&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			When his condition continued to worsen, Mr. Stremmel entered the UCSF Medical Center ICU in March 2014, and spent the next two&#45;and&#45;a&#45;half months there awaiting a new heart. Dr. Klein increased his medications and prescribed a permanent IV infusion to help support heart function. By Mr. Stremmel's side were his wife and daughter, Piper, who left her job in China to support him; his brother, Steve, also visited frequently.
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			&quot;The ICU nurses are incredibly amazing, and [cardiac transplant surgeon] Dr. [Georg] Wieselthaler came to see me four or five times a week,&quot; said Mr. Stremmel. &quot;This guy is beyond wonderful – one of the most remarkable people I've ever met. He kept telling me, ‘You're going to do fine.'&quot; As the weeks wore on, Dr. Wieselthaler told Mr. Stremmel, &quot;Don't get frustrated or discouraged. Your heart is coming – just be patient.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			On Mother's Day, Dr. Wieselthaler told him, &quot;We have a heart!&quot; The surgery started at 2 a.m. and took about six hours. Mr. Stremmel spent another month recovering in the hospital, and an additional month in San Francisco coming in almost daily for tests. Dr. Teresa De Marco, leader of the Advanced Heart Failure and Heart Transplantation Program, carefully oversaw his post&#45;transplant care and continues to monitor him closely. &quot;She is off the charts – always very positive and encouraging,&quot; said Mr. Stremmel. 
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			He is back to his active lifestyle, lifting weights with a trainer three times a week, riding his bike, and walking a mile&#45;long path around the lake near his office every day. He returned to work the day after getting back to Reno. This summer he will resume his role as auctioneer at the prestigious Coeur d'Alene Art Auction, an event he co&#45;founded more than 25 years ago and which is the nation's biggest and most successful auction of art of the American West.
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			His family's support and his own positive attitude helped Mr. Stremmel do so well. &quot;I knew I would not only survive this, but excel,&quot; he said. &quot;I felt good knowing that I had the very best doctors in the world, and I couldn't be more thankful.&quot;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;
			For more than 30 years, the UCSF Adult Congenital Heart Disease (ACHD) Practice has cared for adults patients with all types of congenital structural heart disease, ranging from simple to complex. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;As breakthroughs in surgical treatment have enabled most children with severe congenital heart diseases to reach adulthood, these patients face a critical dilemma in transitioning from care in pediatric cardiology to adult cardiology. Because their conditions are complex, their care requires the collaboration of an experienced and dedicated team of health care providers with specific training in adult congenital heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Parallel to advances in surgery, the fields of interventional cardiology and electrophysiology have experienced significant growth, driven by technological improvements and better understanding of the mechanisms and intermediate &#45;term results of individual procedures. Our cardiologists have special expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of congenital heart lesions, whether or not they have been previously treated.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Conditions treated by the Adult Congenital Heart Disease Program include (but are not limited to):&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aortic coarctation
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Atrial septal defect
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ebstein anomaly
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eisenmenger syndrome
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Marfan syndrome
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pulmonary stenosis
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Single ventricle lesions including patients with a Fontan procedure
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tetralogy of Fallot
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Transposition of the great arteries • Tricuspid artesia

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;At UCSF, our cardiologists evaluate and treat the peripheral vascular needs of patients.  They use an interdisciplinary approach with podiatrists, vascular surgeons, and radiologists to evaluate claudication and limb ischemia, non&#45;healing ulcers and renal vascular disease with hypertension. They perform Ankle Brachial Index measurements and use ultrasound, and computed tomography to assist in the evaluation of the patients’ renal, subclavian, iliac, and femoral arteries. &lt;/p&gt;
			 
			&lt;p&gt;The interventional cardiologists are specially trained to perform diagnostic tests, called peripheral angiograms, to identify blockages in the vessels.  They are able to treat significant blockages in the peripheral system with angioplasty and stents. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/ucsfhealthcardiology.ucsf.edu/files/images/ep.jpg&quot; class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;UCSF's Cardiac Electrophysiology and Arrhythmia Service is known worldwide for its pioneering work in the field. The first ablation in humans was performed at UCSF in 1981 by Dr. Melvin Scheinman. Since then, many other procedures for arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms) have been developed or advanced at UCSF.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;We have a reputation for excellence in the evaluation and treatment of patients with a variety of cardiac arrhythmias. An experienced &lt;a href=&quot;/care/clinical/electro/facultystaff.html&quot;&gt;team&lt;/a&gt; of nine full&#45;time academic cardiac electrophysiologists, as well as expert nurses and technicians, are devoted to the care of patients with abnormal heart rhythms. We perform over 400 catheter ablation procedures and 900 total procedures annually, including implantation of permanent pacemakers, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, and biventricular pacemakers and defibrillators. This high volume ensures efficiency and expertise in the treatment of arrhythmias.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Over the past two decades, tremendous advances have been made in understanding the mechanisms of cardiac arrhythmias. Doctors from UCSF have always been at the forefront in the assessment of the heart's electrical functions, studying arrhythmias under controlled conditions with electrophysiology (EP) studies. We design and participate in many clinical trials with the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration and pharmaceutical and device companies to discover better treatments. This is an advantage for patients, since many of the new investigative therapies, devices and medications may be more effective for treatment than the traditional ones. Today, UCSF's Electrophysiology &lt;a href=&quot;/care/clinical/electro/facultystaff.html&quot;&gt;team&lt;/a&gt; successfully &quot;cures&quot; 95% to 98% of patients with supraventricular tachycardia (arrhythmias originating in the upper chambers of the heart), and over 75% of patients with ventricular tachycardia (arrhythmias originating in the lower chambers of the heart).&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;We are constantly pioneering new technology and treatments through research, but our primary goal is to provide specialized and personalized care for our patients. We have developed this web site for you and your physician to become familiarized with our Cardiac Electrophysiology and Arrhythmia Service. If you have further questions or need more information, please contact us at (415) 476&#45;5706. For physicians seeking to refer patients, see &lt;a href=&quot;/care/clinical/electro/physicians.html&quot;&gt;For Referring Physicians&lt;/a&gt;.

		<FileBody>
			
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;The University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Advanced Heart Failure and Pulmonary Hypertension program is an internationally recognized program that offers the full spectrum of therapies for heart failure patients, such as lifestyle and dietary modifications, disease management, evidence&#45;based pharmacotherapy, electrophysiological devices, mechanical circulatory support and heart transplantation. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Our multidisciplinary &lt;a href=&quot;/care/clinical/hyper/faculty.html&quot;&gt;team&lt;/a&gt; of experts – including physicians, nurses, pharmacists, dietitians, physical therapists and social workers – works closely with &lt;a href=&quot;/care/clinical/hyper/physicians.html&quot;&gt;referring physicians&lt;/a&gt; to relieve symptoms, slow disease progression, prolong survival and improve quality of life in patients with heart failure. The team evaluates and can assist in the management of patients with risk factors for heart failure, as well as patients with mild, moderate or advanced stage disease.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In addition to the approximately 5,000 heart failure patients across UCSF practices, our program evaluates several hundred new patients every year. State&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art genetic testing, imaging modalities (3D echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, cardiac positron emission tomography, and coronary computed tomography), invasive/interventional procedures (right and left heart catheterization, myocardial biopsy, coronary angioplasty, valvuloplasty, and alcohol septal ablation) and cardiac surgeries (mitral valve repair, ventricular reconstruction, high&#45;risk coronary artery bypass, ventricular assist device implantation, and heart transplantation) are all available at UCSF. &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;width:384px;padding:5px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/ucsfhealthcardiology.ucsf.edu/files/images/demarco2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Teresa De Marco, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Treatment options can include both &lt;a href=&quot;/care/clinical/hyper/patients.html&quot;&gt;conventional&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/care/clinical/hyper/research.html&quot;&gt;experimental therapies&lt;/a&gt;. Intensive case management using dedicated nurses and nurse practitioners, innovative teaching materials, and a comprehensive transition of care model helps patients and families adhere to medication regimens and make sustainable lifestyle changes. Our enhanced discharge program is characterized by tightly spaced follow&#45;up visits and careful coordination with external physicians and caregivers. As a result, our &lt;a href=&quot;/care/clinical/hyper/outcomes.html&quot;&gt;readmission rates&lt;/a&gt; are among the lowest in the nation, making our program a model in California.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;For patients 65 years of age and older, we can coordinate care with the specialized clinical practices from the Division of Geriatrics who are experienced in evaluating and addressing older adults’ needs. This ensures that older heart failure patients, who are at highest risk for readmission, receive a physician house call within 48 hours of discharge and a follow&#45;up visit within seven days. Physicians and nurse practitioners work closely with each patient’s visiting nurse, primary care provider and caregivers to optimize the patient’s well&#45;being and reduce the need for emergency room visits and hospitalizations.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;For those patients with advanced heart failure (stage D), characterized by progressive symptoms and poor quality of life despite optimal pharmacological and electrical device therapies, we offer a full spectrum of therapies, including mechanical circulatory devices and heart, heart&#45;kidney and heart&#45;lung transplantation. With over twenty years of experience and more than 260 patients transplanted to date (including 10 heart&#45;lung and 20 heart&#45;kidney transplants), the UCSF Heart Transplant Program is one of the most experienced and successful in the region, with &lt;a href=&quot;/care/clinical/hyper/outcomes.html&quot;&gt;outstanding outcomes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Multidisciplinary care and technical advances make our Mechanical Circulatory Support Program a viable option for an increasing numbers of patients as a short&#45;term bridge to recovery, a longer&#45;term bridge to transplant, or as destination therapy. UCSF is unique because we offer expertise in both mechanical circulatory support and extracorporeal life support, and have experience in using nearly all FDA&#45;approved devices. Each year, 15&#45;20 devices are implanted at UCSF. Our physicians are particularly skilled at recommending the right approach and device for each patient. We also carefully train patients and their families, and offer 24/7 clinical and technical support once they return home. Our follow&#45;up program extends to training local fire departments, emergency medical services and emergency rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The UCSF Pulmonary Hypertension Program was established over two decades ago, and is designated as a center of excellence for the evaluation and treatment of the disorder. Our program actively follows more than 250 patients, offering a full spectrum of care ranging from oral, inhalational and catheter&#45;based therapies to &lt;a href=&quot;/care/clinical/hyper/research.html&quot;&gt;experimental therapies &lt;/a&gt; and lung transplantation. A team of physicians, nurse practitioners, pharmacists and social workers – dedicated to education as well as approved, state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art pharmacologic and surgical management (including lung transplantation) – creates patient&#45;centered, individualized management programs that optimize care and help patients better manage their condition.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Clinical Outcomes&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Under the leadership of Teresa De Marco, MD, the Advanced Heart Failure and Pulmonary Hypertension Program at the University of California, San Francisco has some of the best outcomes in the nation.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;We strive to provide high&#45;quality health care to all of our patients. As such, data from The Joint Commission (the independent, not&#45;for profit organization that accredits and certifies more than 19,000 health care organizations and programs in the U.S.) shows that nearly 100% of our hospitalized heart failure patients are counseled to stop smoking, are provided with comprehensive discharge instructions, have their left ventricular systolic function evaluated, and are being prescribed evidence&#45;based heart failure therapies (ACE inhibitors or ARBs).&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The national 30&#45;day readmission rate for Medicare heart failure patients is very high, at 24.5%. In contrast, UCSF has one of the lowest rates in the nation, with an average for 30&#45;day all cause heart failure readmissions of only 11%. In addition, our 90&#45;day readmission rate is also one of the best in the nation at 26%. Over 450 individual patients are admitted annually at UCSF for acute decompensated heart failure; due to our expertise, the inpatient and 30&#45;day post discharge mortality rates are also lower than the national average.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Each year, 15&#45;20 transplants are performed at UCSF, with more than 260 patients transplanted to date (including 10 heart&#45;lung and 20 heart&#45;kidney transplants). Recent national data compiled by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.srtr.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients&lt;/a&gt; found that the one&#45;year survival rate for heart transplantation at UCSF was 97%, compared to a national survival rate of 89%.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Interventional Cardiology is a subspecialty of cardiology in which catheter&#45;based diagnostic tests and treatment are provided for coronary artery disease, valvular disease, structural heart disease, peripheral vascular disease and various other diseases.  Interventional cardiologists are specially trained cardiologists who use tiny catheters which are inserted into the arm, leg or neck and are then threaded through arteries or veins to the heart or other regions in the body.  &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;At UCSF, our interventional cardiologists perform diagnostic tests such as coronary angiograms (also called cardiac catheterizations), in which contrast or dye is placed in the coronary arteries and peripheral arteries to identify blockages in the vessels. They also perform other procedures that assist with diagnosing complex disease processes.  In addition to the traditional access site in the femoral artery in the groin, UCSF interventional cardiologists are very experienced in using the radial artery approach in the wrist. This approach makes the procedures safer, is less likely to result in bleeding complications, and allows patients to walk immediately after their procedure rather than needing to remain lying down for up to eight hours.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;In addition to diagnosing and treating coronary artery disease with angioplasty and stenting procedures, the UCSF interventional cardiologists are specially trained in innovative catheter&#45;based methods to treat structural heart diseases and peripheral arterial diseases.  They perform percutaneous aortic, mitral and pulmonary valvuloplasty, ethanol ablation, PFO and ASD closure, and peripheral arterial interventions. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The UCSF interventional cardiology labs have state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art technology and equipment.  The high&#45;resolution digital labs are also capable of rotational angiography, minimizing patients’ exposure to contrast (radiation). In addition, certain complex procedures are performed under magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance in a Stereotaxis room, which combines traditional X&#45;ray technology with MRI to facilitate procedures that would otherwise be difficult, if not impossible, to perform. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/care/clinical/inter/faculty.html&quot;&gt;Our team&lt;/a&gt; of experienced interventional cardiologists, fellows, nurses, and technicians are dedicated to providing advanced cardiovascular care to our patients.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://healthyheart.ucsf.edu/about.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Center for Prevention of Heart and Vascular Disease&lt;/a&gt; is a patient service&#45;driven, medical cardiology clinic and integrated support program devoted to the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Led by a team of clinical cardiologists at the UCSF Medical Center, our physicians see outpatients who are referred to us by their primary care doctors due to a documented or assessed risk of heart disease or, following recovery from a previous heart attack or stroke. We provide targeted diagnostic testing, echocardiogram imaging, stress assessment and other clinical care services to diagnose, monitor and manage risk factors that can lead to heart disease. For patients already living with a heart condition we help them devise optimal strategies to best manage their existing condition and achieve good quality of life. To supplement medical care in clinic, we also offer a suite of prevention services including customized diet and exercise programs with licensed professionals who have helped many of our patients achieve and sustain favorable results.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Founded in 2008, we are a part of the Heart and Vascular Care Center clinic of the UCSF Medical Center. In our first two years, working from the eleventh floor of the main hospital at Parnassus, our patient population increased approximately 30% per year to 750. On November 1, 2010, we opened the doors of our new facility on the ground floor of the Smith Cardiovascular Research Institute Building (CVRI) located on the Mission Bay campus of UCSF. Today we see the majority of our cardiology outpatients at this location.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Our Center is made possible through the generosity of a founding gift from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.schwabfoundation.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Charles and Helen Schwab Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, with additional support from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.safewayfoundation.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Safeway Foundation&lt;/a&gt; and through the ongoing, generous support of our &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:Jacqui.Lang@ucsf.edu&quot;&gt;Cardiology Council members&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;For more information, please contact us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:info@healthheart.ucsf.edu&quot;&gt;info@healthheart.ucsf.edu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Treatment of amyloidosis is given to improve symptoms and extend life. Treatment can limit further production of amyloid proteins and, in some instances, promote the breakdown of amyloid proteins in affected organs. The type of treatment required varies depending on the type of amyloidosis and the patient's symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;For &lt;b&gt;AL Amyloidosis&lt;/b&gt;, also called &lt;b&gt;primary amyloidosis&lt;/b&gt;, treatment includes agents to stop the growth of the abnormal cells that produce the amyloid protein. Treatment is not a cure but with newer modalities of treatment, patient outcomes have improved.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The drugs used are similar to those used to treat multiple myeloma, such as chemotherapy [cyclophosphamide, melphalan], proteasome inhibitors [bortezomib, carfilzomib], immunomodulatory drugs [lenalidomide, pomalidomide] and corticosteroids. 
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High&#45;dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation is also a treatment modality. Patients undergo an extensive work&#45;up to evaluate organ function and the effects that amyloidosis has had on the body. In those with adequate heart, liver and lung function, high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell rescue is considered.
			&lt;p&gt;Your own stem cells are collected from the blood after giving a growth factor. About two weeks later you are admitted to the hospital to receive high&#45;dose melphalan chemotherapy over one day. Then your own stem cells, previously collected, are re&#45;administered via a vein two to three days later. An additional two to four weeks are spent in the hospital awaiting recovery and growth of the bone marrow.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The hope is that this therapy will delay progression of the disease and improve survival. However, this therapy is not a cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
			 &lt;p style=&quot;margin&#45;top:&#45;20px;&quot;&gt;Several new investigational agents are being evaluated in the treatment of multiple myeloma, another plasma cell disorder. The hope is that some of these agents also may be effective in treating AL amyloidosis. &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Investigational agents are also being evaluated to remove amyloid protein that has deposited in the organs.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;Treatment for other types of amyloidosis&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;In &lt;b&gt;AA amyloidosis&lt;/b&gt; [&lt;b&gt;secondary amyloidosis&lt;/b&gt;], the main goal of therapy is to treat the underlying condition — for example, taking an anti&#45;inflammatory or disease modifying medication for rheumatoid arthritis or antibiotics for an infection.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;In &lt;b&gt;hereditary amyloid&lt;/b&gt;, since the protein [mutant transthyretin] that causes this form of amyloidosis is made in the liver, liver transplantation is an option. The new liver does not produce the abnormal amyloid protein and consequently the disease improves.&lt;/p&gt;
			 &lt;p&gt;Investigational drugs are also being evaluated to try and prevent this type of amyloid protein from depositing in organs.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;Heart Transplant and Kidney Transplant&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;In selected patients with amyloidosis, heart transplant and kidney transplant have been performed.  &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;Management of symptoms&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Symptoms such as fluid retention are treated with medications to remove fluid [diuretics] and low&#45;salt diet.
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In cases of low blood pressure/dizziness on standing – medications to help stabilize the blood pressure may be considered.
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
			 &lt;p style=&quot;margin&#45;top:&#45;10px;&quot;&gt;At the UCSF Comprehensive Amyloid Center, a multidisciplinary team evaluates the patient and then discusses further with the patient and the patient’s caregivers the appropriate treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Amyloid is a multi&#45;system disease that often requires care from providers across different disciplines. Our team works together to coordinate between cardiologists, hematologists, oncologists, among others to provide the best, most comprehensive care possible. At your visit, you will be guided to see the appropriate providers. If your provider thinks you may have amyloidosis, a biopsy may be performed on the site wherein the suspected amyloid deposits are located. A biopsy uses a needle to remove a small amount of tissue to test for the disease and is almost always an outpatient procedure.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Treatment of amyloidosis is given to improve symptoms and extend life. Treatment can limit further production of amyloid proteins and, in some instances, promote the breakdown of amyloid proteins in affected organs. The type of treatment required varies depending on the type of amyloidosis and the patient's symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;For &lt;b&gt;AL Amyloidosis&lt;/b&gt;, also called &lt;b&gt;primary amyloidosis&lt;/b&gt;, treatment includes agents to stop the growth of the abnormal cells that produce the amyloid protein. Treatment is not a cure but with newer modalities of treatment, patient outcomes have improved.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The drugs used are similar to those used to treat multiple myeloma, such as chemotherapy [cyclophosphamide, melphalan], proteasome inhibitors [bortezomib, carfilzomib], immunomodulatory drugs [lenalidomide, pomalidomide] and corticosteroids. 
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High&#45;dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation is also a treatment modality. Patients undergo an extensive work&#45;up to evaluate organ function and the effects that amyloidosis has had on the body. In those with adequate heart, liver and lung function, high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell rescue is considered.
			&lt;p&gt;Your own stem cells are collected from the blood after giving a growth factor. About two weeks later you are admitted to the hospital to receive high&#45;dose melphalan chemotherapy over one day. Then your own stem cells, previously collected, are re&#45;administered via a vein two to three days later. An additional two to four weeks are spent in the hospital awaiting recovery and growth of the bone marrow.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The hope is that this therapy will delay progression of the disease and improve survival. However, this therapy is not a cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
			 &lt;p style=&quot;margin&#45;top:&#45;20px;&quot;&gt;Several new investigational agents are being evaluated in the treatment of multiple myeloma, another plasma cell disorder. The hope is that some of these agents also may be effective in treating AL amyloidosis. &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Investigational agents are also being evaluated to remove amyloid protein that has deposited in the organs.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;Treatment for other types of amyloidosis&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;In &lt;b&gt;AA amyloidosis&lt;/b&gt; [&lt;b&gt;secondary amyloidosis&lt;/b&gt;], the main goal of therapy is to treat the underlying condition — for example, taking an anti&#45;inflammatory or disease modifying medication for rheumatoid arthritis or antibiotics for an infection.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;In &lt;b&gt;hereditary amyloid&lt;/b&gt;, since the protein [mutant transthyretin] that causes this form of amyloidosis is made in the liver, liver transplantation is an option. The new liver does not produce the abnormal amyloid protein and consequently the disease improves.&lt;/p&gt;
			 &lt;p&gt;Investigational drugs are also being evaluated to try and prevent this type of amyloid protein from depositing in organs.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;Heart Transplant and Kidney Transplant&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;In selected patients with amyloidosis, heart transplant and kidney transplant have been performed.  &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;Management of symptoms&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Symptoms such as fluid retention are treated with medications to remove fluid [diuretics] and low&#45;salt diet.
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In cases of low blood pressure/dizziness on standing – medications to help stabilize the blood pressure may be considered.
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
			 &lt;p style=&quot;margin&#45;top:&#45;10px;&quot;&gt;At the UCSF Comprehensive Amyloid Center, a multidisciplinary team evaluates the patient and then discusses further with the patient and the patient’s caregivers the appropriate treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h2&gt;Signs and Symptoms of Amyloidosis&lt;/h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Amyloidosis causes a variety of symptoms, depending on the type of amyloidosis and the organs involved. In primary (AL) amyloidosis most commonly affected organs include the kidneys, heart, nervous system, and the gastrointestinal tract. Secondary (AA) amyloidosis most commonly affects the kidneys. In familial amyloidosis, the organs involved depend on the particular genetic mutation, but the most common are the nervous system and heart. Age&#45;related amyloidosis primarily affects the heart. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cardiac amyloid&lt;/b&gt;: When amyloid deposits in the heart it causes the heart muscle to become stiff. This can lead to a condition called heart failure, which can cause shortness of breath and accumulation of fluid, often leading to leg or abdominal swelling. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kidney&lt;/b&gt;: When amyloid builds up in the kidneys it often cause a loss of protein into the urine, a condition called proteinuria. Patients with proteinuria often notice foamy urine. Proteinuria eventually leads to swelling of the ankles. Some patients may go on to develop kidney failure. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nervous system&lt;/b&gt;: Deposition of amyloid fibrils into the nervous system causes damage to nerves, a condition known as neuropathy. The exact symptoms depend on the nerves involved. In peripheral neuropathy, patients often feel a loss of sensation in the hands and feet, and may experience a burning pain. Autonomic neuropathy, on the other hand, affects the nerves responsible for organ functions. In this situation patients may experience dizziness or loss of consciousness when standing up, diarrhea, constipation, or sexual dysfunction in males. Patients with amyloidosis may also develop carpal tunnel syndrome. In this condition the median nerve of the hand is compressed, causing pain and/or weakness in the hand. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gastrointestinal system&lt;/b&gt;: Amyloid can deposit anywhere in the digestive system. This can lead to weight loss, bleeding in the intestines, and difficulty swallowing. Other symptoms such as diarrhea or constipation can occur due to involvement of the autonomic nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Other symptoms: &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enlargement of the tongue
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hoarseness
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bleeding or easy bruising
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Skin and nail changes
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;What is amyloidosis?&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Amyloidosis refers to a group of diseases that are caused by the abnormal deposition of certain proteins (amyloid fibrils) in tissues throughout the body.  The specific type of protein involved determines the type of amyloidosis. Many different types of amyloidosis have been identified, each with their own symptoms and treatment. Below is a list of the most common.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin&#45;top:80px;margin&#45;left:20px;&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/care/clinical/amyloid/images/amyloid&#45;cardiac.png&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Cardiac H&amp;E Stain. Photo provided by Dr. Philip Ursell.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
			
			&lt;h2&gt;Amyloid types&lt;/h2&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Primary (AL) amyloidosis&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Primary amyloidosis is the most common type of amyloidosis in the United States.  Primary amyloidosis develops when plasma cells in the bone marrow produce an abnormal protein that forms amyloid deposits throughout the body. Any organ of the body can be involved, including the kidneys, nerves, heart, and gastrointestinal tract.  Primary amyloidosis is often associated with another bone marrow disease, multiple myeloma. Stem cell transplant and medications including chemotherapy may be treatment options for patients with primary amyloidosis. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Secondary (AA) amyloidosis&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Secondary amyloidosis develops in patients with a chronic inflammatory condition such as infection or rheumatoid arthritis.  Chronic inflammation leads to increased levels of a protein called SAA, which forms amyloid fibrils and deposits in organs.  The most common site of involvement in secondary amyloidosis is the kidney. Treatment is aimed at the underlying condition causing the inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Familial amyloidosis&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Familial amyloidosis is an inherited condition passed down in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning each child of an affected parent has a 50% chance of inheriting the abnormal gene. The genetic mutations associated with familial amyloidosis most often cause an abnormality in a protein called transthyretin (TTR). The abnormal TTR proteins form amyloid fibrils that deposit in organs throughout the body.  &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Age&#45;related (senile) amyloidosis&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Senile amyloidosis occurs when otherwise normal TTR proteins form amyloid fibrils that deposit in the heart and other organs. Senile amyloidosis primarily affects older men. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Patients with all forms of congenital heart disease, from simple to complex, are seen in this practice.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;There are more than 40 different types of structural congenital heart disease, including bicuspid aortic valve, atrial septal defects, ventricular septal defects and pulmonary valve stenosis.  Patients with tetralogy of Fallot (repaired or unrepaired), transposition of the great arteries and coarctation of the aorta have more complex disease, but are reaching adulthood in greater numbers due to improved treatment options.  Patients with single ventricles who have had palliative surgery such as the Fontan operation.  &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Excellent sources of information for patients and providers include:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;span style=&quot;font&#45;weight:bold;font&#45;style:italic;font&#45;size:1.4em&quot;&gt;Adult Congenital Heart Disease&lt;br&gt;
			A New and Better Challenge
			&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
			&quot;The heart has to develop perfectly in order to function totally normally,&quot; said Dr. Ian Harris, director of the UCSF Adult Congenital Cardiology Program. &quot;There is very little tolerance of error in the development process. If there is a severe error, the fetus does not survive, and even minor developmental errors may cause significant congenital heart disease.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Before the modern era of surgery, most children with complex heart defects died early. Fortunately, due to major advances in the last several decades, most babies with congenital heart defects &amp;mdash; those present at birth &amp;mdash; are now living into adulthood. &quot;As of about 2002, there were more adults than children with congenital heart disease in the US,&quot; said Dr. Harris. This has led to the development of a large group of patients who require specialized care.
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			&quot;A lot of patients are under the impression that since they had surgery as children, their problem was fixed,&quot; he said. &quot;However, although many conditions can be improved through surgery, most patients are not cured. Today we have very effective treatments for patients, especially when we have an opportunity to intervene before they develop life&#45;threatening problems.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			The UCSF Adult Congenital Cardiology Program is helping lead the way in discovering how to best care for adults living with heart defects. The program receives about 10 new referrals a week, and follows about 5,000 patients who were born with structural heart defects, including holes in the heart, missing parts or inappropriate anatomical connections. 
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;h4&gt;Comprehensive Team&lt;/h4&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
			The program brings together a multidisciplinary team of experts to care for these complex patients, who may have one of more than 40 different conditions. &quot;Rather than a collection of independent practitioners who have an interest in congenital defects, we have an unusually comprehensive and interdisciplinary program,&quot; said Dr. Harris. Many of the team's experts are also conducting cutting&#45;edge research to learn more about how congenital heart disease develops, and are discovering better treatments that will help more patients live full, healthy lives.
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology suggest that patients with congenital heart defects be seen at least once in a specialty center like UCSF's, and that those with moderately complex disease be seen on a regular basis. The Adult Congenital Cardiology Program provides a wide array of services, including a comprehensive medical evaluation, advanced medical investigations and treatments, and personalized recommendations about diet, exercise, psychosocial support, family planning and high&#45;risk obstetrical services.
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Because many congenital heart defects may run in families, the program also collaborates with the Cardiovascular Genetics Program to provide genetic counseling and testing to help identify other family members who may be affected. The team also works closely with referring physicians, particularly because many patients come from out of state and receive their routine care locally.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;h4&gt;Lifelong Care of Complex Conditions&lt;/h4&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
			The interdisciplinary nature of the program is exemplified by the care provided to patients with the most common complex congenital condition: tetralogy of Fallot. This syndrome includes four defects of the heart and its major blood vessels: a hole between the right and left ventricles &amp;mdash; the two lower chambers of the heart; a narrowing of the pulmonic valve and pulmonary artery, which connect the heart with the lungs; an aorta that is shifted over to the right ventricle and the hole between the two ventricles, instead of connecting with the left ventricle; and a thickened right ventricle wall.
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			&quot;The most common problems we see are leakage of the pulmonic valve, arrhythmias (irregular heart rhythms) and heart failure, and they form a vicious cycle,&quot; said Dr. Harris. &quot;The more leakage there is through the pulmonic valve, the greater the enlargement of the heart, which then leads to greater risk of arrhythmias and heart failure. These problems occur silently over time, and treatment usually involves replacing the pulmonic valve.&quot; The UCSF Adult Congenital Cardiology Program is leading a number of studies to better identify the ideal timing for intervention, when replacing the valve is truly needed, but not so late that the patient has developed irreversible heart damage.
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			With the recent recruitment of Dr. V.S. Mahadevan, UCSF now has the capacity to perform valve replacement using catheter&#45;based procedures, in which cardiologists thread small devices through blood vessels up into the heart. This approach can spare appropriate adult congenital heart disease patients the need for an open&#45;heart procedure, when most of them have already had two or three such operations by their 20s and are at higher risk for complications.
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			So far, the data have shown that often just replacing the pulmonic valve is not sufficient to optimize a patient's health. A collaborative effort at UCSF involving cardiologists, electrophysiologists, and congenital cardiac surgeons is investigating whether coupling the valve replacement with other treatments, such as treating their arrhythmias or implanting a defibrillator, can support better long&#45;term outcomes. &quot;As part of a research program spearheaded by one of our congenital cardiac surgeons, Dr. Tara Karamlou, we are standardizing our approach and evaluating whether each component results in an improvement,&quot; said Dr. Harris. &quot;If it does, we continue it. If it doesn't, we modify it and test it again.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			This type of careful tracking and evaluation is particularly important, since these conditions are relatively rare. &quot;We will never have the opportunity to get 5,000 of these patients together and randomize them to one treatment or another, so we have to come up with a more innovative way to develop clinical evidence,&quot; said Dr. Harris.
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Ultimately, some adult congenital heart disease patients may become transplant candidates, and the program collaborates closely with UCSF's outstanding heart and lung transplant programs.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			 
			&lt;h4&gt;Investigating Causes of Heart Defects&lt;/h4&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
			Another path of discovery is the laboratory research that many UCSF faculty members are conducting into the root causes of heart defects. For example, Dr. Harris is working with Dr. Brian Black in the Cardiovascular Research Institute on illuminating the complex genetic and molecular pathways that contribute to the formation of the human heart in utero. They are focusing on the cardiac outflow tract, a structure that eventually develops into the aorta, pulmonary artery and the outflow segments of the right and left ventricles. There are three different types of cardiac tissue that all converge in this one area during fetal development. &quot;When you have three populations interacting, they all have to be on their game,&quot; said Dr. Harris. &quot;If one of them is running a little bit late, it ends up not playing its part, and you end up with a defect that affects the other lineages.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Drs. Harris and Black have identified multiple genes that are expressed differently in these hearts than in normal hearts, and they hypothesize that these aberrant patterns of gene expression may play important and unanticipated roles beyond the abnormal cardiac development. For example, they found that problematic hearts have difficulty producing the correct proteins that regulate heart rhythm and electrical signaling, and these irregularities could contribute to problems later in life, even if the patient receives the best surgical interventions. &quot;This is just a hypothesis at this point, but if it is true, a lot of these [molecular variations] could be drug targets in the future,&quot; said Dr. Harris.
			&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;h4&gt;Supporting Healthy Pregnancies&lt;/h4&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
			Along with Dr. Elyse Foster, the Araxe Vilensky Endowed Chair in Cardiology, and colleagues in the Department of Obstetrics, Dr. Harris also helped lead the formation of the Pregnancy and Cardiac Treatment (PACT) program, which brings together experts from maternal&#45;fetal medicine, obstetrical anesthesiology, perinatal genetics, nursing and other disciplines to care for women with adult congenital heart disease who are pregnant or are thinking of starting a family. &quot;Many heart defects are associated with much higher risks to a woman's own health and to a successful pregnancy, and there is a perception in the medical community that most of these defects are absolute contraindications to pregnancy,&quot; said Dr. Harris. &quot;But what we have found here at UCSF is that most of these conditions can be managed successfully.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			The PACT team offers preconception counseling, outlining possible risks of pregnancy and identifying defects that could be passed on to a child. The team can conduct a functional assessment of a woman's ability to exercise, demonstrating how her heart might respond to the extra demands of carrying a fetus. They may perform advanced imaging or cardiac catheterization to evaluate the heart and any repairs it has already undergone. In some cases, the team may recommend prophylactic surgery or intervention to improve the heart's ability to tolerate pregnancy.
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			During pregnancy, women are carefully monitored, and the fetus may also undergo echocardiography to assess for any congenital heart defects of its own. If there are problems with the fetus's heart, the family is connected with the UCSF Fetal Treatment Center. In collaboration with the high&#45;risk obstetrics group, the team also develops a strategy to manage stress on the mother's heart during labor. Even after a successful delivery, the new mother is carefully monitored, since it takes about a month for hormonally related changes to the cardiovascular system to revert to a pre&#45;pregnancy state.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;h4&gt;A Growing Field&lt;/h4&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
			Not every heart defect is diagnosed in infancy or childhood. For example, the most common congenital heart defect is a bicuspid aortic valve, in which the valve between the left ventricle and the aorta has only two leaflets &amp;mdash; flaps that open and close &amp;mdash; instead of three. Often, this does not cause problems until middle age, when the valve begins to stiffen and develop what is called aortic stenosis. &quot;The usual form of aortic stenosis &amp;mdash; narrowing and calcification of the aortic valve &amp;mdash; typically becomes noticeable when patients are 70 and 80, but when we see it in a 50&#45;year&#45;old, it's almost always because of an underlying bicuspid aortic valve,&quot; said Dr. Harris. The team monitors such patients, and can refer them for aortic valve replacement at the appropriate time.
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			In recognition of the complexity and growth of knowledge in the field of adult congenital heart disease, the American Board of Medical Specialties recently approved the creation of a new subspecialty in this area. The UCSF Division of Cardiology is among the first centers in the country to receive approval for a fellowship training program in adult congenital heart disease, and that program's first fellow, Dr. Anu Agarwal, started in July.
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			&quot;What I like about this area of cardiology is that we almost never see the same thing twice, and I get to see a dizzying array of different problems,&quot; said Dr. Harris. It is not extraordinary for his group to see patients with combinations of anatomical defects which have never been reported in the medical literature, or where the underlying causes of defects are not clear.
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			&quot;I encourage referring physicians to think of us if they have a patient with a cardiac problem that they can't quite identify,&quot; said Dr. Harris. &quot;We enjoy the challenge of seeing these patients, and there are a lot of mysteries out there that we are interested in helping to solve.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;It is recommended that patients with simple forms of congenital heart disease be seen at least once in consultation in an adult congenital heart disease service. Those with moderate and severe conditions should be seen at least yearly in an ACHD service.  We recommend that all women with suspected or known congenital heart disease be evaluated when they are contemplating having a child or are in the early stages of pregnancy, to determine their associated cardiovascular risk and the need for management.

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;We offer echocardiography (cardiac ultrasound) for all patients with cardiovascular disease. The tests are performed by specially trained technologists called sonographers, and in the case of the transesophageal echocardiogram, by a specially trained cardiologist. The echocardiographic images are moving images that show the heart chambers as well as blood flow in the heart; they are stored on a computer for interpretation by a specially trained cardiologist called an echocardiographer. Cardiac nurses and nurse practitioners also assist with stress echocardiograms and with transesophageal echocardiography. &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;Our services include:&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;b&gt;Transthoracic echocardiography&lt;/b&gt; is performed by placing a transducer on your chest wall in a variety of locations. There is no special preparation for this examination, and the only discomfort you may feel is some pressure on your chest. The examination typically lasts one hour or less and the results will be available to your physician within 48 hours. Your doctor will receive information about the function of your heart, including the cardiac chambers and the heart valves, and will gain information about the pressures in your heart.
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Three&#45;dimensional imaging&lt;/b&gt; using techniques similar to those described above will be performed in some patients to gain better visualization of certain conditions.
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Contrast echocardiography&lt;/b&gt; may be performed if the echocardiographic images are not clear, or if your there is suspicion of a communication between the chambers of your heart. In this case, a nurse will place an intravenous line to inject the contrast. This contrast differs from X&#45;ray contrast and may consist of saline solution or a special agent designed for use with echocardiography.  History of allergy to X&#45;ray contrast is not a contraindication to contrast echocardiography.
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stress echocardiography&lt;/b&gt; may require you to exercise, or may be done with a medication that increases your heart rate and blood pressure if you are unable to exercise.  If any form of stress echocardiography has been ordered, you cannot eat for four hours prior to the examination. If you are performing exercise, you should wear comfortable clothes. Even if you are performing exercise, you may have an intravenous catheter placed to improve the imaging of your heart or to gain additional information about heart function.
			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Treadmill echocardiography&lt;/b&gt; is usually done to evaluate chest pain to see if you have coronary artery disease with blockage in the arteries supplying your heart with blood. 
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supine bicycle echocardiography&lt;/b&gt; is performed if you have high pressures in your lungs or if you have valvular or congenital heart disease. This form of testing gives your doctor information about the changes that occur with exercise due to your heart problem. 
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dobutamine stress echocardiography&lt;/b&gt; is done in patients who are unable to exercise.  Dobutamine is given intravenously, starting at low doses and increasing the dose every 3 minutes. Heart rate and blood pressure increase with each dose, and the heart is examined with ultrasound to see the effect of this form of stress on your heart. You are monitored with an electrocardiogram continuously to make sure abnormal heart rhythms do not occur. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Transesophageal echocardiography&lt;/b&gt; is a test which uses a special scope fitted with an ultrasound transducer that is placed in the esophagus after numbing the back of throat with lidocaine and sedating you with medications. You must fast for a minimum of six hours before coming to the laboratory, and someone must be with you to accompany you home. You cannot drive after receiving the sedation. There are many reasons to perform this test, but the most common ones are to investigate possible infection of the heart valves (endocarditis), to evaluate a defect in the wall between the upper chambers of the heart (atrial septal defect), to investigate a possible reason for a stroke in younger patients, and to evaluate heart valves, both artificial and native valves.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
			&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;width:300px;padding:5px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/ucsfhealthcardiology.ucsf.edu/files/images/foster2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Dr. Elyse Foster with cardiology patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;p&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;big&quot;&gt;Cardiac MRI and CT&lt;/span&gt; are used to evaluate patients who have suspected or known problems with their heart or blood vessels. MRI and CT are used in different ways, and which one is appropriate will depend upon the reason for the examination. Some specifics about each of these techniques are listed below:&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cardiac MRI&lt;/b&gt; uses a strong magnet to produce images; no radiation is involved. During imaging, patients are placed within the magnet for a variable amount of time ranging from 10 minutes to one hour, during which time they remain relaxed and still. The scan is painless, although people occasionally have a slight flushing feeling in their face. The injection of intravenous contrast may be required in certain cases. This is given through a small intravenous line that is placed by one of the radiology nurses or technologists.
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cardiac CT&lt;/b&gt; uses ionizing radiation to produce images. The radiation imparted by CT scans varies depending upon why the CT is being obtained. More information on CT radiation can be found at the UCSF Radiation Safety website (http://www.radiology.ucsf.edu/patient&#45;care/patient&#45;safety/radiation).  CT scans are much quicker than MRI, and usually only takes a few minutes to perform. Intravenous contrast is required for the majority of cardiac examinations, with the exception of coronary calcium screening.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;big&quot;&gt;Nuclear cardiology&lt;/span&gt; studies use noninvasive techniques to assess the amount of blood flow to the heart muscle itself, evaluate the pumping function of the heart, and visualize the size and location of a heart attack. During a myocardial perfusion test, the technique most widely used, the images are combined with exercise (walking on a treadmill or riding a stationary bicycle) or medication&#45;induced stress testing.. A very limited amount of an imaging agent labeled with a tiny quantity of radioactive material is injected into the blood stream during rest, and during exercise or chemical stress. A specific scanning device (gamma camera or positron emission tomograph) is used to measure the uptake by the heart of the imaging material. Healthy heart muscle tissue will absorb the radioactive “tracer.” If there is significant blockage of a coronary artery, the heart muscle may not be getting enough of a blood supply in the setting of exercise or during chemical stress. This decrease in blood flow will be detected by the images. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Myocardial perfusion studiescan thus identify areas of the heart muscle that have an inadequate blood supply, as well as the areas of heart muscle that are scarred from a heart attack. In addition to the localization of the coronary artery with atherosclerosis (hardening and narrowing of the artery due to plaque buildup), myocardial perfusion studies quantify the extent of the heart muscle with a limited blood flow and can also provide information about the pumping function of the heart. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Another important application of nuclear cardiology includes the evaluation of cardiac function with radionuclide ventriculography, in which the imaging agent is injected into the bloodstream and pictures of the four chambers of the heart are taken. In addition, nuclear cardiology techniques can be used to determine which areas of the heart muscle have been damaged by infection or heart attack, and can help cardiologists assess the nervous system of the heart when the heart muscle is damaged. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Consultation for Catheter Ablation&lt;/h3&gt;		&lt;!&#45;&#45; photo of patient with RN or MD &#45;&#45;!&gt;
			
				&lt;p&gt;At UCSF, there is a team of doctors, nurses, and technicians who all play a role in performing your procedure. We perform more than 500 ablation procedures each year. You will first meet with one of the UCSF heart rhythm physicians and nurse practitioners to discuss whether you are a candidate for an ablation procedure. This depends on what symptoms you have from from your fast heart rhythm, whether there is a serious or life&#45;threatening risk, and if you have any other coexistant heart disease. We also see many patients for second opinions about ablation, particularly if you have have complex heart disease or recurrences of your arrhythmia after ablation at other centers. You will discuss with your physician what to expect during and after the ablation procedure, and what are the benefits and risks. Your physician and nurse will discuss what tests are needed prior to ablation (generally an echocardiogram, stress test, ECG and and blood tests). If your doctor has already performed these tests, bring copies of the results and any relevant records of prior treatment of your heart or heart rhythm to your visit.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Your physician will also discuss with you the risks of catheter ablation. The risks are infrequent, but potentially serious, and vary depending on the ablation procedure. Some possible risks your doctor may discuss include bleeding in the groin at the catheter puncture sites, damage to the heart or blood vessels, or heart block requiring placement of a pacemaker.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;a name=&quot;prepare&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;Preparing for the Ablation Procedure&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;If you and your physician agree to have an ablation procedure, you will meet with one of the electrophysiology team nurse practitioners, Pat Malone, RN, MSN, NP or Lutsiya Ibragimova. They will review what to expect before, the day of, and following the ablation procedure. Most ablations are performed as outpatients, however after ablations for atrial fibrillation (AF) and ventricular tachycardia (VT), patients generally stay for one night in the hospital following the ablation. UCSF will check with your insurance company that the procedure is covered, and obtain pre&#45;approval before your arrival.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;During the week prior to ablation, you will receive a phone call from the PREPARE clinic, when you will discuss your history with an anesthesiologist. Most ablations are performed with sedation delivered by an anesthesiologist. Ablations for supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) are generally performed with conscious sedation in which you are awake but relaxed, while more complicated ablations such as AF or VT are performed under general anesthesia.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;During your prepare phone call, the anesthesiologist will discuss the anesthesia to be used and can answer any concerns you may have about the anesthesia. If you have significant heart or lung disease, the anesthesiologist may ask to meet you in person before the procedure. If you are having an AF ablation, you will also undergo a CT scan or MRI of the heart prior to the procedure. This is to determine the anatomy of your pulmonary veins (everyone has a different branching pattern); your doctor can use the image during the procedure to guide the ablation. You will also receive a lab slip to have blood drawn during the week prior to ablation. This is to make sure there are no abnormalities with your electrolytes, blood count, or blood thinning before the ablation procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;If you are on a heart rhythm medication, you will be asked to stop it several days before the procedure so your doctor can be sure to localize and ablate all the AF triggers. If you are on a medication to control the heart rate, you will be asked to hold it the day of the procedure. If you are on warfarin, it may be continued through the ablation procedure or held for several days before, depending on your doctor’s preference, blood thinning level, and whether you have an artificial heart valve. Other blood thinners such as dabigatran or rivaroxaban are generally held the day of the procedure. You should not eat anything after midnight on the day prior to your ablation procedure. If you are taking other medications, you may take these the morning of the procedure with a sip of water. The cardiac electrophysiology nurse will review with you what medications you should take the morning of the procedure. If you wish to come to the UCSF area the night before, a list of discounted area hotels can be provided.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;a name=&quot;dayof&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;Day of the Ablation Procedure&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The day of the procedure you will be asked to come to the hospital at 6:30 a.m. You will meet the anesthesiologist attending your procedure, have an IV placed, and have your chest and groin shaved. If you are undergoing an AF ablation, you may also need a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) prior to the procedure. This is performed after you are asleep by inserting a small tube into your esophagus (swallowing tube) to be sure there are no clots in your heart before performing the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;You will meet the TEE fellow and attending in the morning. You will also meet the electrophysiology fellow involved in your procedure with your attending physician. The idea that trainees are involved in the procedure sometimes leads to some anxiety. You should rest assured that have a second physician involved in the procedure is actually a great help to your attending physician. The fellows at UCSF are some of the best in the country. The fellows involved in AF ablations have completed a general cardiology fellowship, and already have extensive experience performing electrophysiology procedures, including AF ablation. There are multiple sources of information being monitored, including the electrical signals recorded inside your heart, the mapping system, intracardiac echocardiography, fluoroscopy, etc. Having a second doctor contributing to the procedure makes it easier for your attending to perform the procedure.
			The length of the procedure may vary from 1&#45;2 hours to 6&#45;8 hours, depending on the complexity of the procedure. There is a waiting room outside the electrophysiology laboratory available for family members.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;a name=&quot;hosp&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;Hospital Stay After the Ablation Procedure&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;After the procedure, you will be taken to the holding area if you received conscious sedation, or to the post&#45;anesthesia care unit (PACU) if you received general anesthesia. Some nausea and grogginess is normal. Even though your doctors may talk to you after the procedure, you may not remember this – short&#45;term memory loss can be an effect of the anesthesia. You will need to lie flat for 4&#45;6 hours after ablation to allow the groin sites to heal. These are not stitched closed; pressure is merely help after the catheters are removed. If your ablation was a straightforward ablation for SVT, you may be discharged home from the EP recovery area. The EP team will give you a list of medications to continue and prescriptions for any new medications, as well as instructions for any restrictions. If any questions or concerning symptoms occur after discharge, you can call one of the EP nurses during the day at 415 476&#45;5706. After hours, the EP fellows and an attending EP physician are on call for emergencies. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;If you are having an AF or VT ablation, you will spend the night in a hospital bed while we monitor your heart rhythm. You may be started back on some of your outpatient medications. If you had a Foley catheter placed in your bladder at the beginning of the procedure, this will be removed once you can get out of bed. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;You will be monitored by the electrophysiology staff after the procedure. A determination will be made if it is safe for you to go home. Prescriptions will be given to you for any new medications, and your medical regimen reviewed. You will be given a list of your medications, follow&#45;up appointments, and any instructions and important contact numbers when you leave the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;a name=&quot;after&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;After the Ablation Procedure&lt;/h3&gt;
			  
			&lt;p&gt;It is normal to feel “out of sorts” for a few days after the procedure. You may also have some discomfort in your chest when taking a deep breath for a few days – this is related to inflammation around the heart after the procedure. You should call your nurse or doctor if you experience:&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;ol&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
			Worsening chest pain 
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Bleeding from your groin puncture sites 30 or a fever higher than 100 degrees F° 
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Pain or difficulty swallowing
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Difficulty or pain with urination 
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Worsening shortness of breath 
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Worsening swelling, particularly if asymmetric 
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Worsening cough, particularly if coughing up colored or blood&#45;tinged sputum.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;During the few weeks after an AF ablation procedure, it is possible that you may still have some episodes of AF. This is related to irritability and should improve during the healing process. You will be sent home with a small heart card monitor so that you can transmit your heart rhythm to us over the phone with any AF symptoms. Call you doctor if you feel you are back in AF persistently. We generally favor early cardioversion if the AF persists to help facilitate the remodeling process and help your heart learn to stay in a normal rhythm. You will typically remain on a blood thinner for at least the first month after an AF ablation. You should have an appointment with your doctor within 4&#45;6 weeks of hospital discharge.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Can anticoagulation be stopped after catheter ablation of AF?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Regardless of your stroke risk profile (see medical management of AF), your physician will typically place you on anticoagulation for at least 1&#45;3 months following ablation. According to the AHA/ACC guidelines, anticoagulation after AF ablation should be guided by the CHADS2 risk score rather than AF symptoms. However, at some point one must weight the risks of anticoagulation against the benefits in the absence of clinical AF. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Drs. Randy Lee and Nitish Badhwar are pioneering a new technique combining removal of the left atrial appendage with pulmonary vein isolation to treat AF. The left atrial appendage, in addition to being the main source of clot formation in AF, can also be a common trigger site in persistent AF patients. Dr Lee has developed a procedure to allow removal of the left atrial appendage using catheters similar to those used in ablation, without needing to open the chest (see LAA removal below). By combining this procedure with AF ablation, we hope to be able to improve the success rate of ablation in persistent AF patients and eliminate the need for anticoagulation.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;When medications are not working or desired for treating AF, an alternative therapy is catheter ablation. The current guidelines from the American Heart Association (below) indicate that catheter ablation should be considered for any patient after AF has recurred on an antiarrhythmic drug. &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;
			
			&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/ucsfhealthcardiology.ucsf.edu/files/images/sinus.png&quot; style=&quot;width:500px;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Multiple randomized studies have demonstrated that if AF is recurring on drug therapy, freedom from AF at 1&#45;year will be significantly better with ablation compared to trying a different antiarrhythmic drug. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;During an ablation procedure, catheters are threaded through veins in your groin into your heart by a heart rhythm doctor (electrophysiologist). The catheters can be used to vaporize or “ablate” the heart tissue responsible for initiating and maintaining the AF, returning your heart to a normal rhythm. The benefit of AF catheter ablation is a much better suppression of AF, and possibly long term freedom from AF in many patients, without the need for multiple daily heart medications. There are also risks associated with the ablation, as with any invasive cardiac procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;For information about Catheter Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation, see &lt;a href=&quot;/care/clinical/electro/ablation&#45;prepplus.html&quot;&gt;Catheter Ablation Procedure&lt;/a&gt;.
			
			&lt;h3&gt;AV Node Ablation/Pacemaker Placement&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In some patients with AF, the heart rate cannot be controlled despite multiple heart rate controlling medications (see table 1). AF ablation is a reasonable option in these patients. Persistent rapid heart rates can lead to a weakening of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy) that can eventually lead to congestive heart failure if untreated. However, some patients may be too ill to tolerate a prolonged ablation procedure. This may be in the case in patients who are elderly (&gt;80 years of age) or have multpliue other comorpid conditions (kidney failure, end stage emphysema). In this case a simple ablation procedure can be used to “disconnect” the upper from the lower heart cambers. A single catheter is threaded through the groin into the heart to the AV node, the “wire” connecting the top and bottom heart chambers. A single ablation lesion to this area will permanently create “heart block” and electrically separate the bottom chambers from the normal pacemaker in the upper chamber of the heart. A permanent pacemaker must then be implanted to set the heart rate of the lower chambers. Often a special biventricular pacemaker will be placed to allow synchronous contraction of both lower chambers of the heart with pacing.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The advantage of this approach is that with a relatively simple procedure, symptoms of palpitations from AF are permanently eliminated without the need for medications. Sometimes the cessation of multiple heart rate controlling medications may improve energy level. Disadvantages of the approach are that AF is not eliminated, and lifelong anticoagulation must be continued. In addition, the heart rate is dependent on the artificial pacemaker, and if the pacemaker malfunctions or the battery is allowed to drain the underlying heart rhythm may be absent or extremely slow.&lt;/p&gt;

There are also risks associated with the ablation, as with any invasive cardiac procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;For information about Catheter Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation, see &lt;a href=&quot;/care/clinical/electro/ablation&#45;prepplus.html&quot;&gt;Catheter Ablation Procedure&lt;/a&gt;.
			
			&lt;h3&gt;AV Node Ablation/Pacemaker Placement&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In some patients with AF, the heart rate cannot be controlled despite multiple heart rate controlling medications (see table 1). AF ablation is a reasonable option in these patients. Persistent rapid heart rates can lead to a weakening of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy) that can eventually lead to congestive heart failure if untreated. However, some patients may be too ill to tolerate a prolonged ablation procedure. This may be in the case in patients who are elderly (&gt;80 years of age) or have multpliue other comorpid conditions (kidney failure, end stage emphysema). In this case a simple ablation procedure can be used to “disconnect” the upper from the lower heart cambers. A single catheter is threaded through the groin into the heart to the AV node, the “wire” connecting the top and bottom heart chambers. A single ablation lesion to this area will permanently create “heart block” and electrically separate the bottom chambers from the normal pacemaker in the upper chamber of the heart. A permanent pacemaker must then be implanted to set the heart rate of the lower chambers. Often a special biventricular pacemaker will be placed to allow synchronous contraction of both lower chambers of the heart with pacing.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The advantage of this approach is that with a relatively simple procedure, symptoms of palpitations from AF are permanently eliminated without the need for medications. Sometimes the cessation of multiple heart rate controlling medications may improve energy level. Disadvantages of the approach are that AF is not eliminated, and lifelong anticoagulation must be continued. In addition, the heart rate is dependent on the artificial pacemaker, and if the pacemaker malfunctions or the battery is allowed to drain the underlying heart rhythm may be absent or extremely slow.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The first catheter ablation in humans was performed by Dr. Melvin Scheinman in 1981, using high energy DC shocks. Dr Scheinman remains today as an active member of the electrophysiology group at UCSF.  Dr Scheinman’s work led directly to the development of radiofrequency energy catheters, which use radiofrequency energy to heat the catheter tip and perform much more precise ablation than was possible with DC ablation. Cather ablation has been used for many years to treat arrhythmias due to a focal source or pathway, such as AV nodal reentrant tachycardia or Wolff&#45;Parkinson&#45;White syndrome. However, only over the past decade has catheter ablation been used to treast more complex rhythms like atrial fibrillation.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In 1998, Michelle Haissaguerre, a cardiac electrophysiologist in Bordeaux, France first described the use of catheter ablation for patients with atrial fibrillation. He put catheter in patients’ hearts and mapped the origin of the “triggers” that start atrial fibrillation. He found that 95&#45;96% of the time these triggers originate in sleeves of muscle that extend into the pulmonary veins (PV), the veins that drain blood from the lungs back into the left upper chamber of the heart (left atrium).  By mapping these triggers during the initiation of AF and ablating them within the pulmonary vein, he was able to render 62% of patients free of AF without the need for antiarrhythmic drugs. This landmark finding has led to the development of catheter ablation as a routine management strategy for AF.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot; &gt;Location of AF triggers in 38 patients with AF. From Haissaguerre et al. NEJM 1998.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The initial strategy for catheter ablation of AF was to map and ablate these triggers within the pulmonary vein. Patients were brought to the electrophysiology lab and given adrenaline to try and initiate their AF. If no AF could be initiated patients were sent home. If triggers were initiated the earliest activation point was mapped and ablated.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;div class=&quot;frame_center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/ucsfhealthcardiology.ucsf.edu/files/images/rainbow.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Figure: Pulmonary venogram (left) with multiple catheters in the right upper pulmonary vein (RUPV) The trigger for AF within the PV was mapped and shown in red in the left panel as the site of earliest activation of AF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br clear=all&gt;
			&lt;div class=&quot;frame_right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/ucsfhealthcardiology.ucsf.edu/files/images/circular.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Circular mapping catheters used for electrical PV isolation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Although this strategy worked in some patients, it was limited by the inability to induce AF triggers in up to 1/3 of patients, and a high recurrence rate after ablation. In the series published by investigators at UCSF in 2001, long&#45;term success (freedom from AF without drugs 14 mos after ablation) was 33%, with an additional 13% of patients who had no AF, but remained on drug therapy. The other problem with this approach was that ablation distally within the pulmonary vein could sometimes lead to a constriction or stenosis of the pulmonary vein, which could lead to chronic shortness of breath. While treatable with PV “stenting,” it was clear that a better approach was needed.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In 1991, Haissaguerre again described a new approach for PV isolation. Instead of mapping the individual triggers inside the PV, ablation was performed more proximally where the PV inserted into the left atrium. By using a circular catheter with multiple electrodes on it, one could localize the muscle sleeve connections and electrically disconnect the entire PV from the left atrium. This effectively prevented any triggers inside the PV from starting AF, even if they could not be provoked in the electrophysiology laboratory.  Thus, the procedure of empiric 4 PV disconnection for treating AF was born. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			
			&lt;div class=&quot;frame_center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/ucsfhealthcardiology.ucsf.edu/files/images/chart.jpg&quot; class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Electrical disconnection of the PV by ablating the site of earliest activation at the PV os using recordings from the circular mapping catheter (L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Since 2001, several incremental improvements in the PV isolation approach have been developed. The location of PV isolation has moved more proximally, from the PV ostium to the antral insertion of the PV, several centimeters proximal to the PV ostium. This so called “wide area circumferential ablation” or WACA, also known as PV antral isolation, has several advantages. First, the likelihood of PV stenosis has decreased dramatically. Second proximal AF triggers that may originate from the PV antrum are also eliminated, and third, modification of nerve bundles that innervate the atria and contribute to AF maintenance may also be ablated. Thus the current procedure involves placement of several catheters into the heart, transseptal puncture to cross into the left atrium, and radiofrequency ablation in a “connect&#45;the&#45;dots fashion to proximally isolate the PV antrum. A temperature sensor is typically placed within the esophagus to indicate any heating of the esophagus while ablating in the posterior left. Use of noninvasive imaging of the heart with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging can be used to guide ablation. 3D reconstruction of the left atrium can be registered with the catheter mapping system so that the catheter is manipulated inside a 3D reconstruction of the individual patients left atrium. This allows tailoring of the ablation lesions to variation in left atrial size and PV anatomy.&lt;/p&gt; 
			
			&lt;div class=&quot;frame_center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/ucsfhealthcardiology.ucsf.edu/files/images/chest.jpg&quot; class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Figure: CT angiogram of the left atrium and esophagus. The structure in purple is the left atrial appendage.The white and blue dots represent ablation lesions around the pulmonary veins. The blue dots represent lower power lesions delivered on the posterior wall of the left atrium when in the vicinity of the esophagus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In addition to PV isolation, at UCSF we continue to also search for AF triggers outside of the PVs, which may account for up to 5% of AF triggers, more commonly in women. This is performed by giving an infusion of isoproterenol (adrenaline) to try and trigger AF and localize the site of origin. Common sites of origin outside the PVs include the superior vena cava, crista terminals, and mitral valve annulus. In addition occasionally regular rapid rhythms due to common arrhythmias such as AV node reentry, Wolff&#45;Parkinson&#45;White syndrome, or atrial tachycardia may trigger AF. If this is the case, a simpler ablation to address the underlying problem may be all that is required.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;This PV antral isolation procedure has been accepted at most centers as the standard for patients with paroxysmal AF. The need for repeat procedures may be higher in patients with more persistent forms of AF. Fibrosis, dilatation and other structural changes occur in the atrium after years of AF and tend to make AF more easily sustained. Premature atrial beats from areas outside the PVs may also initiate AF in these patients, and once initiated in the remodeled atria tends to be sustained. Thus ablation of the PV triggers alone may be less likely to render patients with long lasting persistent AF symptom free with a single procedure. Therefore additional left atrial ablation may be performed in some patients, depending on your electrophysiologists practice. Additional ablation targets include ablation of complex fractionated potentials (CAFÉ), linear lesions between the superior PVs or the left PV and mitral valve, or more extensive ablation of the posterior left atrial wall and septum. At UCSF, we favor a conservative approach to ablation focusing on broadly isolating the pulmonary veins. However, some of the above approaches may be employed depending on your AF. &lt;/p&gt;

New Therapies in the Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation: &lt;br /&gt; Left Atrial Appendage Exclusion ./cardiology/care/clinical/electro/appendage.html

			&lt;h3&gt;LAA exclusion in patients with atrial fibrillation at high risk for embolic stroke and limited options.&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The most severe consequence of atrial fibrillation is an embolic stroke.  In patients with AF, there is a five&#45;fold increased incidence of embolic stroke &lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.   The risk of embolic stroke in the general population increases with age.  Therefore, AF is one of the most important causes of embolic stroke in people over the age of 75 years&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  The left atrial appendage (LAA) is recognized as a source of thromboemboli.  Currently, oral anticoagulation (OAC) therapy is the most effective available prophylactic approach in patients with AF at high risk of thromboembolic events&lt;sub&gt;3,4&lt;/sub&gt;.  However, certain patients develop bleeding problems while on OAC therapy; and the risk of severe bleeding increases with age &lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;.  Other patients have embolic events while taking OAC therapy.  Patients with either contraindications to OAC therapy, embolic events while on OAC therapy or intolerance to OAC therapy have few options.  Surgical exclusion of the LAA has been performed for over 70 years. The AHA/ACC/ESC guidelines for treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) and the AHA/ACC/ESC guidelines for treatment of mitral disease recommend exclusion of the LAA during concomitant procedures as a prophylactic measure to eliminate a primary source of thrombus&lt;sub&gt;6,7&lt;/sub&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Investigators, led by Dr. Randall Lee, from UCSF pioneered the development of a percutaneous approach using an epicardial suture for exclusion of the LAA as an option to surgery for those patients with atrial fibrillation at high risk for embolic events with contraindications to OAC therapy, OAC therapy failures or OAC intolerances.  The percutaneous catheter&#45;based LAA ligation procedure using the LARIAT suture delivery device (SentreHeart, Inc, Redwood City, CA) is feasible and effective in humans and produces complete closure of the LAA &lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;LAA exclusion in the treatment of AF&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) for persistent/chronic AF has a 70% single procedure success rate at 1 year with a high rate of recurrence.  Catheter ablation of electrical activity in the LAA for recurrent AF has been successful, leading to increased success rates &lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;.  However, electrical isolation of the LAA with catheter ablation is limited by the risk of tamponade and electromechanical dissociation with the potential for LAA thrombus formation.  LAA occlusion with a percutaneous suture ligation method has been shown to be feasible for acute closure of the LAA and has been shown to result in LAA necrosis and atrophy &lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;.  In addition, LAA isolation with a LAA exclusion device has been reported as a successful therapy for LAA tachycardias &lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;.  Furthermore, LAA isolation &amp; exclusion may contribute to the success of the Cox Maze IV surgical ablation for AF by eliminating focal LAA triggers for atrial tachycardias/atrial fibrillation &lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;.  We have shown that LAA ligation leads to electrical isolation of the LAA and have started a clinical study to determine the effectiveness of LAA ligation and PVI in patients who have had a recurrence of AF after a PVI or in patients with chronic AF. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;What is the LAA?&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The left atrial appendage is a pouch that extends off the top left chamber of the heart (the left atrium). The left atrial appendage is known to start atrial fibrillation and serves as a source of blood clots in patients with atrial fibrillation. The risk of these blood clots is that they can break off and travel to other areas of the body to cause a stroke and/or block blood flow to a part of your body. The left atrial appendage ligation is a procedure that places a suture (type of string) around the bottom of the pouch (appendage). The suture cuts off blood flow to the appendage and prevents a blood clot from forming inside the appendage. Only the left atrial appendage will be tied off, so this procedure will not affect blood flow to any other part of the heart. By getting rid of the electrical triggers from the appendage, this procedure may also make an atrial fibrillation ablation more successful.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;How is LAA ligation performed?&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The LAA ligation is performed after entering the epicardial space through a subxiphoid puncture and the left atrium through a transseptal puncture. A transseptal puncture is a standard procedure used to cross the septum (barrier) between the top 2 chambers of the heart. This procedure uses a special needle and sheath (A sheath is a tube inserted through a vein in the leg and taken up to the heart. For the purposes of the LAA ligation, a wire is placed through the sheath into the tip of the LAA in order to see the location of the appendage by X&#45;ray. A subxiphoid puncture is a procedure used to enter the epicardial space (space between the heart and the sac surrounding the heart). With a subxiphoid puncture a needle is inserted into the skin below the breastbone and directed towards the heart using X&#45;ray. This gives your doctor access to the space around the heart so that a suture may be placed around the bottom of the left atrial appendage. A magnet tipped guide wire is placed at the tip of the LAA via the transseptal catheter and an epicardial magnet tipped guide wire is connected to the endocardial magnet tipped guide wire to stabilize the LAA.  The LARIAT suture delivery device is then guided over the epicardial guide wire and the snare is placed over the LAA.  A balloon catheter inside the LAA allows for the proper positioning of the suture.  The suture is placed using ultrasound and X&#45;ray pictures and is left in place permanently on the outside surface of the heart.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;The management of patients with AF should always address three areas: &lt;a href=&quot;#heart&quot;&gt;control of the heart rate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;#stroke&quot;&gt;stroke risk&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;#sinus&quot;&gt;consideration of cardioversion/maintenance of sinus rhythm&lt;/a&gt;.  Most patients who present with their first episode of atrial fibrillation can be started on oral medications after an initial evaluation with a cardiologist. Patients with prolonged chest pain, congestive heart failure, or a difficult to control heart rate may need to be admitted to the hospital to initiate treatment. Common medications and dosages are shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;a name=&quot;heart&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;Control of the Heart Rate&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;If your heart rate is rapid in AF, your doctor may prescribe medications to slow the bottom chamber of the heart. Three types of drugs can be used to slow the heart rate in AF: these include beta&#45;blockers, calcium channel blockers and digitalis. Common medications and dosages are shown below.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;br clear=all&gt;
			
			&lt;table&gt;
			&lt;thead&gt;
			&lt;th&gt;Medication&lt;/th&gt;
			&lt;th&gt;Starting Dose&lt;/th&gt;
			&lt;th&gt;Maximum Dose&lt;/th&gt;
			&lt;th&gt;Frequency&lt;/th&gt;
			&lt;/th&gt;
			&lt;/thead&gt;
			&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=4 class=&quot;sub&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;B&#45;blockers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
			&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Metoprolol&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;12.5&#45;25 mg&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;200&#45;400 mg&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;twice daily or once daily (long&#45;acting)&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;/tr&gt;
			
			&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Atenolol&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;25mg&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;200mg&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;daily&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;/tr&gt;
			
			&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Carvedolol&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;3.125mg&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;25mg&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;twice daily&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;/tr&gt;
			
			&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=4 class=&quot;sub&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ca blockers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
			
			&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Diltiazem&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;30mg&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;90mg&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;three times daily or once daily (long acting)&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;/tr&gt;
			
			&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Verapamil&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;40mg&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;160mg&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;three times daily or once daily (long acting)&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;/tr&gt;
			
			&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td class=&quot;sub&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digoxin&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td class=&quot;sub&quot;&gt;0.125mg&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td class=&quot;sub&quot;&gt;0.25mg&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td class=&quot;sub&quot;&gt;daily&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;/tr&gt;
			
			&lt;/table&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Sometimes combinations of the above medications may be required to adequately control the heart rate, for example a β&#45;blocker and digoxin. Your physician may perform a 24&#45;hour heart rate recording or “Holter monitor” to make sure your heart rate is well controlled throughout the day. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Some patients continue to have poor rate control despite multiple medications. Options include consideration of AF ablation (see ablation below) or A&#45;V node ablation and pacemaker placement, which provides complete control of the heart rate without symptoms, but does not correct the underlying AF and renders the patients pacemaker dependent. These options can be discussed with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;a name=&quot;stroke&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;Stroke Risk&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The most feared complication of AF is stroke. Anticoagulation can significantly ameliorate this risk. Five large prospective randomized trials comparing warfarin and placebo in patients with nonvalvular AF have been performed that have proven that anticoagulation with warfarin reduces stroke risk in those AF patients at risk    , ,  A pooled analysis performed by the principal investigators of each trial identified four important clinical risk factors for stroke (see Table 3).  &lt;img src=&quot;/sites/ucsfhealthcardiology.ucsf.edu/files/images/stroke_rish.png&quot; alt=&quot;table 9&quot; class=&quot;imgRight&quot;&gt;Future epidemiologic studies identified the CHADS2 score as an important determinant of stroke risk in AF. CHADS2 stands for the points given to each risk factor as shown on the chart at the right.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Treatment guidelines for anticoagulation in AF patients, depending on the CHADS2 score, have been published by the American College of Cardiology and American Heart 
			Association and are shown in the table below:&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;table&gt;
			&lt;thead&gt;
			&lt;th&gt;Score&lt;/th&gt;
			&lt;th&gt;Risk&lt;/th&gt;

			&lt;/th&gt;
			&lt;/thead&gt;
			&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;Low&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;None or Aspirin&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;Aspirin daily&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;/tr&gt;
			
			&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td class=&quot;sub&quot;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td class=&quot;sub&quot;&gt;Moderate&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td class=&quot;sub&quot;&gt;Aspirin or Warfarin&lt;/td&gt;

			&lt;td&gt;Warfarin&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;INR 2.0&#45;3.0&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;/tr&gt;
			&lt;/table&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;A newer score, the CHADS2&#45;Vasc score has been proposed by the European Society of cardiology and takes into account additional risk factors. The CHADS2&#45;Vasc score is shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h5&gt;CHA2DS2&#45;VASc score for stroke risk in atrial fibrillation&lt;/h5&gt;

			&lt;td class=&quot;sub&quot;&gt;Moderate&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td class=&quot;sub&quot;&gt;Oral anticoagulation (or aspirin)&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td class=&quot;sub&quot;&gt;Warfarin INR to 2.0&#45;3.0, or one of the new oral 
			anticoagulation drugs or aspirin 75mg&#45;325mg daily
			&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;/tr&gt;
			
			&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;2 or greater&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;High&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;Oral anticoagulation&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;Warfarin INR to 2.0&#45;3.0, or one of the new oral 
			anticoagulation drugs
			&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;/tr&gt;
			&lt;/table&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In the past, the only medication available for oral anticoagulation was warfarin. Warfarin is an oral anticoagulant that works by blocking vitamin K production in the liver. Unfortunately there is no standard dose for warfarin, and its effect is measured by a blood test called the INR (international normalized ratio). The warfarin dose must be individualized for each patient and adjusted to maintain the INR between 2.0 and 3.0. Typically blood tests are performed weekly during initiation and eventually reduced to monthly during maintenance. The regular blood tests and dietary restrictions are often an inconvenience to patients. Several newer anticoagulants are being developed that have more predictable effects and do not require blood tests for monitoring. The first of the newer anticoagulants to be approved was a drug named dabigatran (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pradaxa.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PradaxaTM&lt;/a&gt;). A large multicenter randomized trial  showed that this drug, when given at the dose of 150ug twice daily, worked as well as warfarin in preventing strokes with less risk of bleeding. Many physicians now consider dabigatran a suitable alternative to warfarin. Side effects include bleeding and an upset stomach. Rivaroxaban (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xareltohcp.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;XareltoTM&lt;/a&gt;) is another new drug that was recently approved for the prevention of stroke associated with AF. As with dabigatran, a large multicenter study  demonstrated that rivaroxaban worked as well as warfarin in preventing stroke with less bleeding. The advantage of riveroxaban is that it only needs to be taken once daily, and no monitoring of blood tests is needed. Another promising new anticoagulant under investigation is a drug called apixaban (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eliquis.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;EliquisTM&lt;/a&gt;) . Currently these drugs are more expensive than warfarin, so you should check with your insurance company if they are covered. All these drugs are also excreted, in part, by the kidneys. So if you have a history of kidney disease you need to discuss with your doctor whether you are eligible to take on of these new drugs. Warfarin, on the other hand, is completely metabolized by the liver, so it can be taken in patients with kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;All patients with AF due to heart valve disease due to prior rheumatic fever (mitral stenosis), regardless of age, are also at high risk of stroke and should be anticoagulated.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;a name=&quot;sinus&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;Cardioversion/Maintenance of Sinus Rhythm&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Most patients presenting with new onset AF who remain in AF should receive an initial attempt at cardioversion (shock) to restore a normal heart rhythm. Since AF will recur in most patients, the addition of antiarrhythmic agents may also be needed to help maintain sinus rhythm. The decision of when to forgo maintanence of sinus rhythm in favor of anticoagulation and ventricular rate control is a difficult one. In patients with symptoms of palpitations, fatigue, or exertional dyspnea, aggressive attempts to maintain sinus rhythm are certainly warranted. Antiarrhythmic drugs are agents that help the heart maintain a normal rhythm. In general these agents are more potent than the drugs used for heart rate control, and may have additional side effects. These may include fatigue, a slow heart rhythm, and the potential for creating life&#45;threatening heart rhythms in the bottom chambers of the heart. The most potent of these drugs, amiodarone, can also be associated with lung, thyroid and liver toxicities as well as causing problems with vision and nerves. For this reason these drugs are often started in the hospital while the heart rhythm is monitored. Your cardiologist can help decide of a heart rhythm drug is needed and which is best and safest. In the asymptomatic patient, the risk of antiarrhythmic drug therapy must be weighed against the benefit of maintaining sinus rhythm. The commonly used oral antiarrhythmic drugs your doctor may prescribe are outlined in the Table 2 below.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;td&gt;80 mg&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;Twice daily&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;320 mg&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;Slow heart rate, Torsade de pointes VT&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;/tr&gt;
			
			&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td class=&quot;sub&quot;&gt;Dofetilide (Tikosyn)&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td class=&quot;sub&quot;&gt;III&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td class=&quot;sub&quot;&gt;500 ug&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td class=&quot;sub&quot;&gt;Twice daily&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td class=&quot;sub&quot;&gt;1000 ug&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td class=&quot;sub&quot;&gt;Torsade de pointes VT&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;/tr&gt;
			
			&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;Amiodarone (Cordarone)&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;III&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;100&#45;200 mg&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;Daily&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;400 mg&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;Lung fibrosis, liver failure, hyper/hypothyroidism, neuropathy, optic neuritis&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;/tr&gt;
			&lt;/table&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;It should be emphasized that complete suppression of AF with an antiarrhythmic drug is an unrealistic. Even with effective drug therapy, recurrence rates of AF are approximately 50% at 1 year. Often, a more reasonable goal is a reduction in the frequency of AF recurrences. Therefore, each AF recurrence is not necessarily a &quot;failure&quot; of therapy, and drug type or dosage need not be adjusted for infrequent recurrences . This can be discussed with your doctor. The key to successful treatment of AF is tailoring therapy to the individual patient.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Can anticoagulation be stopped after return to sinus rhythm in patients on antiarrhythmic drugs?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Once a patient has been converted to sinus rhythm, the question of stopping anticoagulation always arises. Although it seems intuitively reasonable, there is currently no data to support the assertion that patients in sinus rhythm on antiarrhythmic treatment have a low risk of thromboembolism.  Even patients with significant symptoms from AF can have significant asymptomatic episodes. Therefore, in patients treated with antiarrhythmic drugs, the decision to use antiarrhythmic drugs should be independent of the decision to use anticoagulation. Even if apparent sinus rhythm is maintained, anticoagulation should be continued based on the CHADS2 or CHADS2&#45;Vasc score. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia, affecting approximately 2.5 million people in the United States. The incidence rises with increasing age, affecting approximately 6% of patients over age 65 and 10% of patients over age 80. ,  During atrial fibrillation the typically organized electrical activation of the upper chambers of the heart is replaced by disorganized, chaotic electrical activity. This chaotic electrical activity causes the atria to “quiver” rather than contract normally, leading to stasis of blood in the atria and the potential for thrombus (clot) formation. The site of clot formation during AF is most often an outpunching of the left atrium called the left atrial appendage. If this clot embolizes to the brain, it can cause a stroke. The average stroke risk in AF patients without anticoagulation is 4.5% per year . The chaotic electrical activity in the atria also leads the bottom chambers of the heart (ventricles) to beat rapidly and irregularly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin&#45;left:20px;&quot;&gt;

			&lt;/div&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The symptoms of atrial fibrillation are variable, depending on the individual patient. Some patients have no symptoms at all. Others feel palpitations or an irregular pulse. Many patients experience shortness of breath with exertion. Patients with congestive heart failure, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or aortic stenosis may experience a worsening of their typical symptoms. Another common complaint is fatigue. While the mechanism by which AF causes fatigue is unclear, many patients will feel more stamina in sinus rhythm. Because AF often occurs in older patients, some physicians may attribute fatigue to older age or other cardiac problems. Many patients are often told they should “learn to live” with AF, since it is not life threatening. However, in our experience many symptomatic patients have a significantly improved quality of life if sinus rhythm can be maintained. Therefore, the treatment for AF needs to be individualized for each patient, depending on symptoms, stroke risk, and underlying heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In the Framingham Heart Study,  the strongest risk factor for developing AF was hypertension. Some patients have AF without any hypertension or structural heart disease, and this is typically called “lone AF.” There are also secondary causes of AF including pericarditis (inflammation of the sac around the heart), intermittent heavy alcohol use, lung disease (emphysema or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and hyperthyroidism. Initial laboratory tests can often exclude electrolyte abnormalities and hyperthyroidism. Some patients may notice that their AF episodes occur at rest during the night or after eating a heavy meal. This type of AF is often called “vagal” because it occurs when the resting or “vagal” part if the nervous system is most active. Others may develop AF during exertion, or have “sympathetic” AF. Regardless of the pattern of AF occurrence, the treatment is similar. An echocardiogram (ultrasound) is often performed in AF patients to measure left atrial size and left ventricular function, two indices helpful in guiding management. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;AF occurs in 3 different patterns: &lt;b&gt;P&lt;/b&gt;aroxysmal, &lt;b&gt;P&lt;/b&gt;ersistent or &lt;b&gt;P&lt;/b&gt;ermanent (the three “Ps”). Most patients initially have AF episodes that start and stop on their own, lasting anywhere from minutes to days. This is called intermittent of “paroxysmal” AF. When some patients develop AF they remain in AF until they receive medication or a cardioversion (“shock”) to restore the normal heart rhythm. This type of AF is called “persistent.” Finally, some patients are left to remain in AF long term with only medications to control the heart rate. Once AF has persisted for &gt; 1 year, it is called either “long&#45;lasting persistent” AF, chronic AF, or permanent AF.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia, affecting approximately 2.5 million people in the United States. The incidence rises with increasing age, affecting approximately 6% of patients over age 65 and 10% of patients over age 80. ,  During atrial fibrillation the typically organized electrical activation of the upper chambers of the heart [Criley sinus rhythm animation] is replaced by disorganized, chaotic electrical activity [Criley AF animation]. This chaotic electrical activity causes the atria to “quiver” rather than contract normally, leading to stasis of blood in the atria and the potential for thrombus (clot) formation. The site of clot formation during AF is most often an outpunching of the left atrium called the left atrial appendage. If this clot embolizes to the brain, it can cause a stroke. The average stroke risk in AF patients without anticoagulation is 4.5% per year . The chaotic electrical activity in the atria also leads the bottom chambers of the heart (ventricles) to beat rapidly and irregularly. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The symptoms of atrial fibrillation are variable, depending on the individual patient. Some patients have no symptoms at all. Others feel palpitations or an irregular pulse. Many patients experience shortness of breath with exertion. Patients with congestive heart failure, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or aortic stenosis may experience a worsening of their typical symptoms. Another common complaint is fatigue. While the mechanism by which AF causes fatigue is unclear, many patients will feel more stamina in sinus rhythm. Because AF often occurs in older patients, some physicians may attribute fatigue to older age or other cardiac problems. Many patients are often told they should “learn to live” with AF, since it is not life threatening. However, in our experience many symptomatic patients have a significantly improved quality of life if sinus rhythm can be maintained. Therefore, the treatment for AF needs to be individualized for each patient, depending on symptoms, stroke risk, and underlying heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In the Framingham Heart Study,  the strongest risk factor for developing AF was hypertension. Some patients have AF without any hypertension or structural heart disease, and this is typically called “lone AF.” There are also secondary causes of AF including pericarditis (inflammation of the sac around the heart), intermittent heavy alcohol use, lung disease (emphysema or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and hyperthyroidism. Initial laboratory tests can often exclude electrolyte abnormalities and hyperthyroidism. Some patients may notice that their AF episodes occur at rest during the night or after eating a heavy meal. This type of AF is often called “vagal” because it occurs when the resting or “vagal” part if the nervous system is most active. Others may develop AF during exertion, or have “sympathetic” AF. Regardless of the pattern of AF occurrence, the treatment is similar. An echocardiogram (ultrasound) is often performed in AF patients to measure left atrial size and left ventricular function, two indices helpful in guiding management. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;AF occurs in 3 different patterns: &lt;b&gt;P&lt;/b&gt;aroxysmal, &lt;b&gt;P&lt;/b&gt;ersistent or &lt;b&gt;P&lt;/b&gt;ermanent (the three “Ps”).

Atrial Flutter ./cardiology/care/clinical/electro/flutter.html

		<FileBody>
			
			&lt;h3&gt;What is atrial flutter?&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Atrial flutter is a common fast heart rhythm that affects the top chambers of the heart (called the atria). It is due to a single circuit of electrical activity that rapidly travels around a part of one or both of the atria. This has several effects. First, that rapid electrical activity is transmitted to the lower chambers of the heart (called the ventricles), which pump blood to the lungs and the rest of the body, via a structure called the atrioventricular node, or AV node. The AV node generally does not transmit every impulse, and therefore slows the lower chambers’ response to this rapid atrial activity. However, the ventricles, which are responsible for the pulse, will generally beat at a faster rate than usual. The rhythm of the ventricles and the pulse may beat in either a regular or irregular fashion. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Symptoms that result from Atrial Flutter&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Due to the loss of the normal contraction of the atria and the fast and sometimes irregular ventricular rate, patients with atrial flutter may feel fatigued, short of breath or faint, or may experience palpitations (heart racing or pounding). Some patients have none of these symptoms.  Because atrial flutter episodes may be transient or last for days, weeks or even months at a time, the duration of these symptoms may also vary. Rarely, when a patient does not feel the atrial flutter, but the rhythm results in an abnormally fast ventricular rate over a long period of time, the ventricles may weaken and the patient may develop severe shortness of breath and another condition called congestive heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Atrial Flutter and Stroke&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Because the top chambers of the heart do not move well during rapid activity, blood can stagnate. Whenever blood stagnates, it can form a blood clot. In atrial flutter (as in the closely related rhythm, &lt;a href=&quot;/care/clinical/electro/fib.html&quot;&gt;atrial fibrillation&lt;/a&gt;), blood stagnation and blood clot formation most commonly occurs in an outpouching off the left atrium called the left atrial appendage. When a blood clot forms, it can break off and travel to another part of the body (becoming an embolism) and potentially block or occlude blood vessels, therefore reducing or eliminating blood flow to the organ those blood vessels supply. When the occluded blood vessel supplies blood to the brain, a stroke results. Although this is generally the most concerning complication, occlusion of other blood vessels can also cause other problems. For example, if the occluded blood vessel supplies the heart, a heart attack may result. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Atrial Flutter and Atrial Fibrillation&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Please see the separate section on &lt;a href=&quot;/care/clinical/electro/fib.html&quot;&gt;atrial fibrillation&lt;/a&gt;. Patients with atrial flutter often also have atrial fibrillation, and the two arrhythmias are similar in several ways. In addition, it is important to understand that even if a patient is successfully treated or even “cured” of atrial flutter (such as with ablation as described below), that patient may still be at risk for atrial fibrillation. Atrial flutter is generally more difficult to control with medicines than atrial fibrillation, but ablation is generally simpler and more successful for atrial flutter. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Treatment of Atrial Flutter&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Curative ablation&lt;/b&gt;: 
			The most common type of atrial flutter, called typical atrial flutter, is responsible for the great majority of these abnormal heart rhythms.  Typical atrial flutter is a circuit around the right atrium; the details of this circuit were first discovered and described by UCSF researchers. Ablation is a straightforward, highly successful, and low&#45;risk procedure that can be employed to cure this rhythm.  Ablation involves advancing thin catheters through small incisions in the leg(s) and sometimes the neck, which are then placed into different part of the heart under X&#45;ray guidance. Using those catheters, the exact nature and location of the rhythm can be determined. Using a special catheter that delivers energy, the critical part of the electrical conduction responsible for the fast rhythm is eliminated. For ablation of atrial flutter, the success rate is about 97%. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
			Atypical flutter can sometimes develop either spontaneously or, more often, when the patient has had previous heart procedures. While the success rate of curing these flutters with ablation is usually not as high as it is for typical flutter, such atypical flutters are generally very amenable to ablation procedures. 
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cardioversion&lt;/b&gt;:
			Cardioversion involves administering medication or an electric shock to the heart to convert the atrial flutter to a normal rhythm. While this can be effective in restoring the normal rhythm, cardioversion does not prevent the abnormal rhythm from returning. Medications may decrease the likelihood that atrial flutter will return. If atrial flutter recurs after cardioversion, options include another cardioversion or catheter ablation.
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stroke prevention&lt;/b&gt;:
			The formation of clots that result in strokes and other complications can be prevented by using medicines that thin the blood. A variety of such drugs are now available, and the choice of the particular drug depends on the specific characteristics of the particular patient. Because of the known risk of recurrence of atrial flutter after cardioversion, even a successful cardioversion does not negate the need for these blood&#45;thinning drugs. However, after a patient undergoes a successful atrial flutter ablation, blood thinning agents may no longer be needed. Typically, whether a blood thinning drug is needed after a successful ablation depends on whether or not the patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and the perceived risk of subsequent atrial fibrillation. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
			Whether a normal rhythm is achieved by ablation or electrical or pharmacologic cardioversion, the transition from being in atrial flutter to normal rhythm can temporarily increase the risk of stroke. There are two ways this can be addressed. These are most relevant to patients who undergo their ablation or cardioversion procedure while in atrial flutter: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
			The patient can undergo at least three weeks of blood thinning medical therapy (depending on the drug that is prescribed, this may need to be documented with serial blood tests during those three weeks); or, just prior to the ablation or cardioversion, a patient can undergo a transesophageal echocardiogram. This is a special cardiac imaging procedure in which an ultrasound probe is advanced down the swallowing tube (the esophagus) under sedation, and in this case can be used to rule out the presence of a pre&#45;existing blood clot in the heart.
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Because the transition from atrial flutter to normal rhythm (whether achieved with ablation, electricity or a medicine) can result in a temporary deterioration in atrial function (and therefore a transient higher risk of blood clot formation), blood thinning drugs are generally prescribed for at least one month after these procedures. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other medical treatments&lt;/b&gt;:
			Medicines can also play a role in helping atrial flutter patients with their symptoms. Some drugs can slow down the heart rate during atrial flutter. However, the effectiveness of these medicines is often limited, particularly when patients exercise or even walk. In addition, the dose of these drugs can sometimes be limited by the fact that they lower the blood pressure. Other medicines that actually prevent atrial flutter from occurring can also be prescribed. However, each of these medicines has its own potential side effects, with the risk of the drugs varying with a patient’s other diseases and general status of the patient’s heart. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Atrial Flutter Research at UCSF &lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Previous research at UCSF has been critical in understanding and curing patients with atrial flutter. From the first ablation ever performed to describing the typical atrial flutter circuit itself, UCSF researchers have contributed significantly to advancing the treatment of this disease. More recent research has described new variants of the disease, helping electrophysiologists around the world properly study and treat atrial flutter patients. &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;As part of the ongoing electrophysiology cohort study, Dr. Gregory Marcus is now collecting blood for DNA in atrial flutter patients. This collection now includes more than 150 patients.  This effort has already resulted in several publications in peer&#45;reviewed journals, and will help us understand the basic reasons that patients develop atrial flutter. The data obtained from this effort may also help to identify patients at risk and, by revealing the underlying causes, will be important in developing novel therapies to treat and ultimately even prevent this disease. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h4&gt;If you would like to be seen at UCSF's Division of Cardiology:&lt;/h4&gt; 
			&lt;p&gt;If you feel that you would like to visit the physicians and professional healthcare team at UCSF's Division of Cardiology, there are a few basics you should remember.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;b&gt;If you have a personal physician, ask him/her to refer you.&lt;/b&gt;
			Your personal physician has records of your entire medical history&#45; from what medications you currently take to that upset stomach you complained about four years ago. Working with your personal physician assures you that the team at UCSF will learn about you, the patient&#45; not merely a diagnosis. 
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Make sure you have your medical records with you, or they can be sent to us.&lt;/b&gt; For you to receive the most beneficial care, it's important that the physicians at UCSF can look back at x&#45;rays, test reports, and notes from previous healthcare providers. Most physicians and healthcare organizations will forward your reports to us if you ask. 
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;In their containers, bring all the medicines that you are currently taking with you to your visit.&lt;/b&gt; We would like you to bring the medicines in the bottles that you get from your pharmacy; put all the bottles in a paper bag and bring them to your appointment. This is much better than just a list of the medicines, or the pills in a pillbox! 
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Have your insurance information handy when you call.&lt;/b&gt;
			So that you are fully aware of what will or will not be covered under the medical insurance plan(s) you have, make sure you tell the UCSF representative what your coverage is&#45; before your first appointment. 
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Make a list of your questions.&lt;/b&gt;
			At UCSF, we'll try to explain everything you'll need to know about your individual treatment plan&#45; but if you have a question, it's best to write it down to refer to during your appointment. We want to make sure we address any and all of your concerns. 
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Examine travelling routes and, if necessary, reserve lodgings.&lt;/b&gt;
			If, as many of our patients, you are not familiar with San Francisco, please refer to the directions located on this page as well as the maps on the main UCSF website. If you are going to be staying overnight, make sure to make your plans and call hotels early for reservations. 
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;And, Relax.&lt;/b&gt;
			At UCSF, you'll have a team of professionals working to provide you with the most up&#45;to&#45;date treatment appropriate for your medical condition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Heart failure develops when the heart does not function properly. The description of “heart failure” does not mean that the heart has actually “failed” or stopped, but rather that one or more chambers of the heart “fail” to keep up with the volume of blood flowing through them. Heart failure can be brought on by a variety of underlying diseases and health problems. To learn more about heart failure, by visiting &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ucsfhealth.org/conditions/heart_failure/signs_and_symptoms.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;UCSF Medical Center website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary hypertension is a rare and very serious blood vessel disorder of the lung. Managing this illness and its complications, including right heart failure, requires expertise and access to sophisticated treatment such as oral and continuous intravenous medication, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ucsfhealth.org/conditions/lung_transplant/signs_and_symptoms.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;lung transplantation&lt;/a&gt;. To learn more about pulmonary hypertension, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ucsfhealth.org/conditions/pulmonary_hypertension/signs_and_symptoms.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;visit UCSF Medical Center website&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.phassociation.org/Pulmonary&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hypertension Association website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Patients evaluated in the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Advanced Heart Failure and Pulmonary Hypertension program have access to the most novel pharmacological, electrical (including &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ucsfhealth.org/treatments/implantable_cardioverter_defibrillator/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;implantable cardiac defibrillators&lt;/a&gt; and cardiac resynchronization therapy), surgical (including mitral valve surgery, high risk coronary artery bypass grafting, surgical ventricular reconstruction, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ucsfhealth.org/treatments/ventricular_assist_device/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mechanical circulatory support&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ucsfhealth.org/conditions/heart_transplant/signs_and_symptoms.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;heart transplantation&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;For patients with irreversible heart disease, our program offers them a novel and comprehensive approach. All management decisions are shared with the local health care provider, so continuity of care can be maintained. Patients referred to our team are scheduled in our outpatient clinic within two to three weeks of the original referral.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;To contact the Heart Failure and Pulmonary Hypertension programs, please call &lt;b&gt;(415) 353&#45;9088&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Our multidisciplinary &lt;a href=&quot;/care/clinical/hyper/faculty.html&quot;&gt;team&lt;/a&gt; of experts – including physicians, nurses, pharmacists, dietitians, physical therapists and social workers – works closely with referring physicians, and can assist in the management of patients with risk factors for heart failure, as well as patients with mild, moderate or advanced stage disease.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Once the referring physician contacts our team, the patient is scheduled in our outpatient clinic within two to three weeks of the original referral. The program offers a weekly clinic, enabling patients to see all necessary specialists – including cardiologists and surgeons – in one visit. After evaluating the patient, shared management guidelines are developed, and the care plan is communicated to the referring physician. Early referral to the program is encouraged, as we are often able to delay the disease progression by using state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art approved treatments or enrolling patients in experimental pharmacological and device &lt;a href=&quot;/care/clinical/hyper/research.html&quot;&gt;trials&lt;/a&gt; that are not available at other local centers.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Although there are established criteria for heart transplant candidacy, UCSF has few absolute contraindications. Because UCSF is an academic medical center, the program has greater access to organs as well as novel devices, so fewer patients are ruled out. In addition, with the possibility of performing simultaneous transplantation of the heart and kidney, far more patients become eligible to receive a transplanted heart.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The Mechanical Circulatory Support program offers ventricular assist devices for every patient, whatever their age, size or gender. The following list represents the devices currently available: &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Short term mechanical support: Abiomed AB5000, Abiomed Impella 2.5L, Abiomed Impella 5.0L, and Thoratec CentriMag.
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Long term mechanical support: Thoratec HeartMate II, Heartware HVAD, Thoratec PVAD and Thoratec IVAD.
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The Pulmonary Hypertension program offers established and novel therapies. The following list represents the therapies currently available: &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oral endothelin receptor antagonists: ambrisentan (Letairis®), bosentan (Tracleer®).
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oral phosphodiesterase inhibitors: sildenafil (Revatio®), tadalafil (Adcirca®).
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inhalational prostanoids: iloprost (Ventavis®), treprostinil (Tyvaso®).
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Subcutaneously&#45;delivered prostanoid: treprostinil (Remodulin®).
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intravenously&#45;delivered prostanoids: epoprostenol (Flolan®, Veletri®), treprostinil (Remodulin®).
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Percutaneous graded blade&#45;balloon atrial septostomy.
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lung transplantation. 
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Genetic Discrimination:&lt;/b&gt;  Individuals considering genetic testing often have concerns about how their test results may affect their current or future insurability.  GINA, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, went into effect in 2009.  This federal law prohibits health insurance and employment discrimination base on genetic information.  For more information, visit the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geneticalliance.org/ginaresource&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Genetic Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.  GINA does not apply to other types of insurance such as life, or long&#45;term disability insurance.  In addition to GINA, the state of California has laws prohibiting genetic discrimination.

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Brugada syndrome is a genetic condition that causes abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias).  Individuals with Brugada syndrome can experience syncope (fainting), ventricular tachycardia (fast heart rhythm), ventricular fibrillation (uncoordinated beating of the heart), cardiac arrest, or even sudden death.  &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The severity of Brugada syndrome varies from person to person even between members of the same family.  Some people may never experience symptoms.  Others may have serious symptoms, including frequent syncope (fainting) or sudden cardiac death. Most people with Brugada syndrome live a normal life. It can be difficult to predict whether an individual will have a mild form of Brugada syndrome or a more severe form. The risk for cardiac arrest tends to be higher in males, in young adulthood, and when someone has had previous symptoms such as syncope, ventricular tachycardia or cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Individuals with Brugada often have a characteristic pattern on electrocardiogram (EKG).  However, this pattern is only present in about a third of people who have Brugada syndrome, and the abnormal pattern is intermittent. Individuals with Brugada syndrome can have an abnormal EKG at one time and normal EKGs at other times. Sometimes specialized tests are used to diagnose Brugada syndrome. Unfortunately, at this time, there is no test that can always determine who has Brugada syndrome, thus, diagnosing the condition can be difficult.  &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Treatment for Brugada syndrome can include avoiding certain medications and preventing/aggressively treating fevers and/or implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) depending upon the risk to the individual.   &lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Genetics&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The abnormal heart rhythms in Brugada syndrome are due to genetic differences in the electrical system that controls the heart rhythm.  Several different genes have been associated with Brugada syndrome but these genes only are responsible for about a third of families with the condition.  We expect to identify more genes responsible for Brugada syndrome as our knowledge in cardiac genetics improves over time.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Brugada syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.  This means that each child of a parent with Brugada syndrome has a 50% chance of inheriting the genetic mutation associated with Brugada.  The chance of inheriting it is the same for men and women. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Many people who inherit the genetic mutation never have any health problems related to Brugada syndrome. Family members who carry the genetic mutation associated with Brugada syndrome undergo an evaluation to determine their risk for serious arrhythmias.  Treatment may be recommended for those at high risk while those at low risk may only require close follow up and avoidance of certain medications.
			
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Genetic testing can be done to try to identify the genetic mutation causing Brugada syndrome to confirm the diagnosis and so other family members can have genetic testing to determine their risk.  &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Family members&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Since Brugada syndrome is a genetic condition, the family members of someone who has the condition may be at risk of developing the abnormal heart rhythms.  Close relatives (parents, siblings, and children) of someone with Brugada syndrome should be evaluated for the condition by consulting a cardiologist familiar with Brugada or through genetic testing if the gene mutation associated with the condition in the family has been found.
			
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Electrophysiologists are cardiologists who are experts in abnormal heart rhythms.  Appointments can be made with the electrophysiologists at UCSF by calling (415) 353&#45;2554.  Electrophysiologists at other hospitals can be located by searching on this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hrsonline.org/PatientInfo/specialist_locator.cfm&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Precautions&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Individual recommendations should be made with the help of a cardiologist. 
			Fever and certain medications can trigger the abnormal heart rhythms in Brugada syndrome. Individuals who have Brugada, have an EKG suggestive of Brugada, or carry a genetic mutation for Brugada syndrome are often advised to avoid these medications and fevers.  A list of medications to avoid is maintained at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brugadadrugs.org&quot;&gt;www.brugadadrugs.org&lt;/a&gt;.

Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia ./cardiology/care/clinical/inhere/arrhythmia/cpvt.html

		<FileBody>
			
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or CPVT is a rare inherited condition that results in abnormal heart rhythms occurring with exercise or activities associated with high adrenaline levels.  These abnormal rhythms are absent at rest but can cause syncope (fainting) or even sudden cardiac death with physical exertion or emotional stress.  CPVT can present at any age but symptoms generally begin in childhood.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;CPVT is not associated with abnormal heart structure so cardiac imaging studies are usually normal.  Resting EKGs are also normal since the abnormal heart rhythms only occur with exercise.  CPVT is diagnosed by cardiac stress (treadmill) test and typical findings include polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (fast abnormal heart rhythm).  &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Medications reduce the risk for syncope and sudden death in individuals with CPVT.  Most of the time CPVT can be effectively treated with medication but if a person continues to have symptoms while taking medication, an internal cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) might be recommended.  &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Genetics&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The abnormal heart rhythms in CPVT are due to genetic differences in the electrical system that controls the heart rhythm.  So far, a couple genes have been associated with CPVT and mutations in these genes are responsible for over half of families with the condition.  We expect to identify more genes responsible for CPVT as our knowledge in cardiac genetics improves over time.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Most commonly, CPVT is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.  This means that each child of a parent with CPVT has a 50% chance of inheriting the genetic mutation associated with the condition.  The chance of inheriting the mutation is the same for men and women. There is a far less common form of CPVT that follows an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.  In this pattern, CPVT is due to two gene mutations, one that has been inherited from each parent.  The siblings of an individual with autosomal recessive CPVT each have a 25% chance of having the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Some people who inherit the genetic mutation never have any health problems related to CPVT.  However, they can still pass the mutation to their children who may develop abnormal heart rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Genetic testing can be done to try to identify the genetic mutation causing CPVT to confirm the diagnosis and so other family members can have genetic testing to determine their risk for abnormal heart rhythms associated with the condition. &lt;/p&gt; 
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Family members&lt;/h3&gt;  
			&lt;p&gt;Since CPVT is a genetic condition, the family members of someone who has the condition may be at risk of developing the abnormal heart rhythms.  Close relatives (parents, siblings, and children) of someone with CPVT should be evaluated for the condition by consulting a cardiologist familiar with CPVT or having genetic testing if the gene mutation associated with the condition in the family has been found.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Precautions&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Individual recommendations should be made with the help of a cardiologist. 
			However, individuals with CPVT may be advised to avoid strenuous exercise since exertion can provoke dangerous heart rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;

Long QT syndrome (LQTS) ./cardiology/care/clinical/inhere/arrhythmia/qt.html
		</Fname>
		<Tax>1736</Tax>
		<Path>./cardiology/care/clinical/inhere/arrhythmia/qt.html</Path>
		<FileBody>
			
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is an inherited heart rhythm disorder affecting approximately 1 in 2500 people.  LQTS is caused by mutations in genes that regulate the electrical activity in the heart.  People with LQTS may experience palpitations, syncope (fainting), or even sudden death.  &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The name of the condition is based on the EKG pattern present in the majority of individuals with the condition.  The QT interval on an EKG represents the time when the heart is relaxing after each heart beat.  This interval can be longer than normal in people with LQTS.  When the QT interval is prolonged, there is an increased risk for a dangerous heart rhythm. &lt;/p&gt; 
			
			&lt;p&gt;Diagnosing LQTS can be difficult because individuals with the condition do not always have abnormal EKGs and QT prolongation can be intermittent.  In fact, about a quarter of people with LQTS have normal EKGs and those with a long QT interval on one EKG may have normal EKGs at other times.  &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Treatment for LQTS is recommended for people with prior symptoms as well as young people without prior symptoms.  Medications (beta&#45;blockers) reduce the risk for syncope and sudden death in individuals with LQTS.  Most of the time LQTS can be effectively treated with medication but if a person continues to have symptoms while taking medication, an internal cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) might be recommended.  With appropriate treatment, people with LQTS can live long, healthy lives.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Genetics&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The abnormal heart rhythms in LQTS are due to genetic differences in the electrical system that controls the heart rhythm.  Over 10 different genes have been associated with LQTS and mutations in these genes are responsible for about three quarters of families with the condition.  We expect to identify more genes responsible for LQTS as our knowledge in cardiac genetics improves over time.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Most often, LQTS is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.  This means that each child of a parent with LQTS has a 50% chance of inheriting the genetic mutation associated with the condition. The genetic mutation does not skip generations.  However the condition may appear to skip generations because some people carry the genetic mutation for LQTS but have a normal EKG and no symptoms.  Even if a person with the genetic mutation does not have symptoms or an abnormal EKG, they can still pass the gene mutation to their children and their children could develop symptoms. The chance of inheriting the gene mutation is the same for men and women. Many people who inherit the genetic mutation will never have any health problems related to long QT syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;There is a far less common form of LQTS that follows an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern and is associated with other physical and medical problems.  In this pattern, the condition is due to two gene mutations, one that has been inherited from each parent.  The siblings of an individual with autosomal recessive CPVT each have a 25% chance of having the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Genetic testing can be done to try to identify the genetic mutation causing LQTS so other family members can have genetic testing to determine their risk for abnormal heart rhythms associated with the condition.  The results of genetic testing can also be useful in medical management for individuals with LQTS.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Family members&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Since LQTS syndrome is a genetic condition, the family members of someone who has the condition may be at risk of developing the abnormal heart rhythms.  Close relatives (parents, siblings, and children) of someone with LQTS should be evaluated for the condition by consulting a cardiologist familiar with LQTS or through genetic testing if the gene mutation associated with the condition in the family has been found.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Electrophysiologists are cardiologists who are experts in abnormal heart rhythms.  Appointments can be made with the electrophysiologists at UCSF by calling (415) 353&#45;2554.  Electrophysiologists at other hospitals can be located by searching on this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hrsonline.org/PatientInfo/specialist_locator.cfm&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Precautions&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Individual recommendations should be made with the help of a cardiologist. 
			Individuals with LQTS are often advised to avoid medications that prolong the QT interval.  Such medications can bring out arrhythmias and can even cause cardiac arrest.  A list of medications to avoid is maintained at &lt;a href=&quot;http&quot;//www.qtdrugs.org&quot;&gt;www.qtdrugs.org&lt;/a&gt;.  Additionally, people with LQTS should stay hydrated since dehydration can also provoke abnormal heart rhythms.  It is a good idea for people with LQTS to wear a medical alert necklace or bracelet.  &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dangerous heart rhythms are sometimes associated with specific triggers in LQTS.  There are different types of LQTS and certain event triggers have been associated with the different types.  Sometimes individuals with LQTS are advised to avoid certain triggers such as exercise, particularly swimming, sudden loud noise, and extreme emotion depending upon their past symptoms and the type of LQTS they have.&lt;/p&gt;

Arrythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy ./cardiology/care/clinical/inhere/cardio/arr_myopathy.html

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Arrythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy or Dysplasia (ARVC or ARVD) is an inherited heart disorder that is characterized by gradual replacement of the right heart muscle with fatty tissue.  The most feared consequences arising from these changes are unstable heart rhythms and sudden cardiac death.  ARVC affects approximately 1 in 5000 people in the United States, with men being approximately three times more commonly affected than woman.  ARVC is caused by mutations in genes that make up the attachment proteins between heart cells (desmosomes). &lt;/p&gt; 
			
			&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of ARVC include palpitations, shortness of breath, syncope (fainting).  People with ARVC also carry a substantially higher risk of sudden death than the general population.  &lt;/p&gt; 
			
			&lt;p&gt;ARVC is diagnosed using the electrocardiogram and echocardiogram/MRI, and a careful family history.  After a diagnosis is made, people with ARVC may receive treatment, consisting of a mixture of behavioral recommendations and medications. If a patient is thought to be at high risk of sudden death, a defibrillator is sometimes implanted by an electrophysiologist.&lt;/p&gt; 
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Genetics&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fewer than 10 different genes have been associated with ARVC and mutations in these genes are responsible for about one third of families with the condition.  We expect to identify more genes responsible for ARVC as our knowledge in cardiac genetics improves over time.  &lt;/p&gt; 
			
			&lt;p&gt;Most often, ARVC is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.  This means that each child of a parent with ARVC has a 50% chance of inheriting the genetic mutation associated with the condition. The genetic mutation does not skip generations.  However the condition may appear to skip generations because some people carry the genetic mutation for HCM but have a normal EKG and no symptoms.  Even if a person with the genetic mutation does not have symptoms or an abnormal EKG, they can still pass the gene mutation to their children and their children could develop symptoms. The chance of inheriting the gene mutation is the same for men and women. Many people who inherit the genetic mutation will never have any health problems related to ARVC syndrome.&lt;/p&gt; 
			
			&lt;p&gt;Genetic testing can be done to try to identify the genetic mutation causing ARVC so other family members can have genetic testing to determine their risk for abnormal heart rhythms associated with the condition.  The results of genetic testing can sometimes be useful in medical management for individuals with ARVC, although not commonly.&lt;/p&gt; 
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Family members &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Since ARVC syndrome is a genetic condition, the family members of someone who has the condition may be at risk of developing the abnormal heart rhythms, fainting or sudden death.  Close relatives (parents, siblings, and children) of someone with ARVC should be evaluated for the condition by consulting a cardiologist familiar with ARVC or through genetic testing if the gene mutation associated with the condition in the family has been found.&lt;/p&gt;

Left Ventricular Noncompaction ./cardiology/care/clinical/inhere/cardio/compaction.html

		<FileBody>
			
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is an heart disorder characterized by a heart that has not fully packed together its individual tissue layers, leading to deep recesses within the muscle wall.  It affects approximately 1 in 700 people. LVNC can sometimes be caused by mutations in genes that encode for structural proteins of heart muscle.  There is approximately a 1 in 5 chance that someone will develop LVNC if a parent, sibling or child has it.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			People with LVNC may experience blood clots in the heart, heart failure, and unstable heart rhythms.  They also carry a higher risk of stroke and sudden death than the general population.  Nonetheless, many people with LVNC can be entirely without symptoms for their whole life.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			LVNC is diagnosed by echocardiogram or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging).  A careful family history can reveal if the LVNC seems to follow an inherited pattern.  &lt;/p&gt;
			
			Treatment for LVNC is recommended to ameliorate symptoms and prevent complications.  Physicians may suggest beta&#45;blockers for unstable heart rhythms and may recommend anti&#45;coagulants to prevent the risk of blood clots.   Other medications may be used for heart failure symptoms. If a patient is thought to be at high risk of sudden death, a defibrillator is sometimes implanted by an electrophysiologist.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Genetics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;  A small number of different genes have been associated with LVNC and these genes are responsible for a minor percentage of individuals with the condition.  As the scientific understanding of LVNC progresses, we expect to identify more genes responsible for LVNC.  &lt;/p&gt;
			
			Genetic testing can be used to try to identify the genetic mutation causing LVNC so other family members can have genetic testing to determine their risk for abnormal heart rhythms associated with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Family members&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;   Since LVNC syndrome can be a genetic condition, the family members of someone who has the condition may be at risk of developing the abnormal heart rhythms, heart failure or sudden death.  Close relatives (parents, siblings, and children) of someone with LVNC should be evaluated for the condition by consulting a cardiologist familiar with LVNC.   In some cases, genetic testing can be performed if the gene mutation associated with the condition in the family has been found.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Precautions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Individualized recommendations about exercise and diet should be made with the help of a cardiologist.&lt;/p&gt;

Familial Dilated Cardiomyopathy ./cardiology/care/clinical/inhere/cardio/dilated.html

		<Tax>1736</Tax>
		<Path>./cardiology/care/clinical/inhere/cardio/dilated.html</Path>
		<FileBody>
			
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a heart disorder characterized by a heart that is enlarged in diameter and weak in pumping function.  Although there are many causes that can lead to a dilated heart, in some subset of patients the DCM appears to be inherited. We suspect that this familial form of DCM affects approximately 1 in 2500 people in the United States, although it may be more common. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;People with DCM may experience palpitations, have difficulty breathing when walking or exercising, and can have difficulty with excess fluid in their body, particularly in the legs. DCM can progress to severe heart failure and can sometimes trigger life&#45;threatening arrhythmias resulting in sudden death. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;DCM is diagnosed by echocardiogram.  Because multiple conditions can cause DCM (such as blockages in the coronary arteries, a past heart attack, or a viral infection) a cardiologist typically screens for these conditions to make sure they are not responsible.  At the same time, a family history of DCM should be obtained, as it can be very helpful in pointing to a genetic basis.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Treatment for DCM is similar to that of heart failure, and involves taking a set of common medications (e.g. beta&#45;blockers, ACE&#45;inhibitors, diuretics).   Because DCM patients may be at higher risk of sudden death from an unstable heart rhythm, they are sometimes given an implantable defibrillator.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Genetics&lt;/h3&gt; 
			&lt;p&gt;Over 20 different genes have been associated with DCM but these genes are responsible for only about one fifth of cases.  We expect to identify more genes responsible for DCM as our knowledge in cardiac genetics improves over time.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;DCM can be inherited in an autosomal or recessive dominant manner.  In the autosomal dominant case, this means that each child of a parent with DCM has a 50% chance of inheriting the genetic mutation associated with the condition. The genetic mutation does not skip generations.  However the condition may appear to skip generations because some people carry the genetic mutation for DCM but have a normal EKG and no symptoms.  Even if a person with the genetic mutation does not have symptoms or an abnormal EKG, they can still pass on the gene mutation to their children and their children could develop symptoms. The chance of inheriting the gene mutation is the same for men and women. Many people who inherit the genetic mutation will never have any health problems related to DCM syndrome.  In the recessive case, a person needs to inherit a mutation from each of their parents to develop the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Genetic testing can be done to try to identify the genetic mutation causing DCM so other family members can have genetic testing to determine their risk for abnormal heart rhythms associated with the condition. The results of genetic testing can sometimes be useful in medical management for individuals with DCM, although genetic test results typically do not affect medical treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Family members&lt;/h3  
			&lt;p&gt;Since familial DCM is a genetic condition, the family members of someone who has the condition may be at risk of developing the abnormal heart rhythms, fainting or sudden death.  Close relatives (parents, siblings, and children) of someone with DCM should be evaluated for the condition by consulting a cardiologist familiar with DCM or through genetic testing if the gene mutation associated with the condition in the family has been found.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Precautions&lt;/h3
			&lt;p&gt;There are no specific behaviors for people with DCM to avoid, though liquid and salt intake are sometimes watched carefully if there are problems with fluid buildup.  Individual recommendations should be made with the help of a cardiologist. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an inherited heart disorder characterized by an abnormally thickened heart.  It affects approximately 1 in 500 people in the United States.  HCM is caused by mutations in genes that make up the structural proteins of heart muscle.  Typically, a patient has a 50% chance of having the condition if a first&#45;degree relative (parent, sibling, or child) has it.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;People with HCM may experience palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, or syncope (fainting).  They also carry a higher risk of stroke and sudden death than the general population.  In fact, HCM is among the top causes of sudden death in young athletes.  HCM symptoms and complications arise from blockage of blood flow out of the heart by the thickened heart muscle and by a loss of the normal organization of the heart muscle cells.   These problems put people with HCM at risk of unstable heart rhythms including atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Diagnosing HCM can be challenging because there are other reasons for a thickened heart, including engaging in heavy athletic activity and having high blood pressure.  HCM experts can help distinguish these conditions, which is essential to helping predict risk of the more severe complications.  &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Treatment for HCM is recommended for people with symptoms and consists of medications (beta&#45;blockers, calcium channel blockers, and an antiarrhythmic drug called disopyramide) that reduce the vigorous contractions of the heart.   If these medications fail to control symptoms, more invasive procedures can be performed to remove some of the obstructing heart muscle.  This is either carried out in the cardiac catheterization laboratory or in the operating room.  If a patient is thought to be at high risk of sudden death, a defibrillator is sometimes implanted by an electrophysiologist.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Genetics&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Over 10 different genes have been associated with HCM and mutations in these genes are responsible for about one half to two thirds of families with the condition.  We expect to identify more genes responsible for HCM as our knowledge in cardiac genetics improves over time.  &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Most often, HCM is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.  This means that each child of a parent with HCM has a 50% chance of inheriting the genetic mutation associated with the condition. The genetic mutation does not skip generations.  However the condition may appear to skip generations because some people carry the genetic mutation for HCM but have a normal EKG and no symptoms.  Even if a person with the genetic mutation does not have symptoms or an abnormal EKG, they can still pass the gene mutation to their children and their children could develop symptoms. The chance of inheriting the gene mutation is the same for men and women. Many people who inherit the genetic mutation will never have any health problems related to HCM syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Genetic testing can be done to try to identify the genetic mutation causing HCM so other family members can have genetic testing to determine their risk for abnormal heart rhythms associated with the condition.  The results of genetic testing can sometimes be useful in medical management for individuals with HCM, although genetic test results typically don’t affect medical treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Family members&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Since HCM syndrome is a genetic condition, the family members of someone who has the condition may be at risk of developing the abnormal heart rhythms, fainting or sudden death.  Close relatives (parents, siblings, and children) of someone with HCM should be evaluated for the condition by consulting a cardiologist familiar with HCM or through genetic testing if the gene mutation associated with the condition in the family has been found.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Precautions&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Individualized recommendations should be made with the help of a cardiologist.  In general, individuals with HCM should avoid becoming dehydrated and taking medications that lower blood pressure.  Since fainting and sudden death can take place during or after vigorous exercise, people with HCM should talk with a cardiologist about what activities are safe or not safe. It’s a good idea for people with HCM syndrome to wear a medical alert necklace or bracelet.  &lt;/p&gt;

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) ./cardiology/care/clinical/inhere/marfan/ehlers-danlos.html

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Ehlers&#45;Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a diverse group of inherited connective tissue disorders, characterized by joint hypermobility, stretchy skin and fragile tissue. There are multiple types of EDS. The different types are classified according to their features and symptoms. Each type of EDS is a distinct disorder that &quot;runs true&quot; in a family. This means that an individual with one type of EDS will not have a child with a different type.  However, EDS can affect members of the same family differently with some being more severely affected than others even though they all have the same type of EDS. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there is no cure for any of the types of EDS.  Treatment depends on the type of EDS, symptoms, and related medical conditions.  Individuals with EDS should speak with their healthcare providers about personalized treatment recommendations.  People with EDS should avoid activities that are hard on the joints such as running or aerobics.  Low impact activities that strengthen the muscles around the joints can be helpful.  &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Genetics&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Some types of EDS are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.  This means that each child of a parent with EDS has a 50% chance of inheriting the genetic mutation associated with the condition. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Some types of EDS follow an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.  In this pattern, EDS is due to two gene mutations, one that has been inherited from each parent.  The siblings of an individual with autosomal recessive EDS each have a 25% chance of having the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In both autosomal dominant and recessive inheritance, the chance of inheriting a gene mutation is the same for men and women.  &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The specific genes associated with EDS are known for some of the types but not all.  Genetic testing may be available depending upon what type of EDS in the family. If the gene alteration causing EDS in a family has been identified, other family members can have genetic testing to determine if they and their children are at risk for the condition.  &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The genes associated with many types of EDS have not been identified so genetic testing cannot be done to make a diagnosis or determine if family members are at risk.  At this time, most types of EDS are diagnosed clinically by having a genetic evaluation.  We hope to identify more genes responsible for EDS as our knowledge in genetics improves over time.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Family members&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Since EDS is an inherited condition, the family members of someone who has the condition may be at risk for symptoms and related medical problems.  Close relatives (parents, siblings, and children) of someone with EDS should be evaluated for the condition by consulting a geneticist or considering genetic testing if the gene mutation associated with the condition in the family has been found.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Medical geneticist and genetic counselors are experts in genetic syndromes such as EDS.  Individuals can be evaluated in the Marfan clinic at UCSF by calling (415) 353&#45;2554.

Isolated Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm and Dissection  ./cardiology/care/clinical/inhere/marfan/isolated.html

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Cardiovascular manifestations of familial thoracic aortic aneurysms and aortic dissections (TAAD) include enlargement and dissection of the thoracic aorta in 2 or more family members.  The thoracic aorta refers to the aorta in the chest cavity.  Below the chest cavity, the aorta is called the abdominal aorta.  Aneurysm and dissection can occur in the abdominal aorta as well but these are not commonly associated with familial TAAD.  Cardiovascular manifestations are usually the only features of TAAD.  Individuals typically have progressive enlargement of the aorta leading to either aortic dissection or consequent tear or rupture. The onset and rate of progression of aortic enlargement is highly variable.  Features of aortic aneurysms and dissections are similar in males and females. The primary symptom of an aortic dissection is severe pain usually in the chest (front, back, or both), but occasionally in the abdomen when the tear involves the abdominal aorta.  Aortic dissection is a serious, life&#45;threatening situation so individuals with symptoms should seek care urgently.  Aortic aneurysm generally do not cause any symptoms.  If you have a family history of aortic aneurysm and/or dissection, it’s very important to seek evaluation even if you don’t have symptoms.  &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Diagnosis of TAAD requires cardiac consultation, an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) to look for aortic enlargement, and genetic evaluation to rule out features of genetic syndromes such as Marfan syndrome or other connective tissue disorders. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Treatment for TAAD depends on the extent of aortic enlargement but may involve taking a medication to protect the heart and blood vessels and/or surgery for more serious heart or vessel problems associated with the condition.  TAAD is not associated with other medical problems.  With appropriate medical care, individuals with TAAD can live long and healthy lives.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Genetics&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Familial TAAD can be caused by alterations (mutations) in many different genes, however, these genes only are responsible for approximately 20% of families with TAAD.   TAAD is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.  This means that individuals with TAAD have a 50% chance to pass the gene mutation to each of their children.  Some people who inherit the genetic mutation never have any health problems related to TAAD.  However, they can still pass the gene mutation to their children who may develop aortic enlargement and or dissection.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Genetic testing can be done to try to identify the genetic mutation causing TAAD so other family members can have genetic testing to determine their risk for aortic enlargement and dissection associated with the condition.  &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Family members&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Since TAAD is a genetic condition, the family members of someone who has the condition may be at risk for related medical problems.  Close relatives (parents, siblings, and children) of someone with TAAD should be evaluated for the condition by consulting a cardiologist or geneticist familiar with the condition or having genetic testing if the gene mutation associated with the condition in the family has been found.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Loeys&#45;Dietz syndrome (LDS) is a genetic disorder that affects the connective tissue in the body.  The condition was first described in 2005 and prior to that was often diagnosed as Marfan syndrome since the two conditions share similar features.  Individuals with LDS can have a variety of different features in many different parts of the body including the heart, blood vessels, bones, joints, and skin. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Since LDS can affect different people in so many different ways, the making a diagnosis can be challenging.  Diagnosing LDS requires consulting specialists familiar with the condition.  Evaluation usually involves an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart), a genetic consultation, and genetic testing.   &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Treatment for LDS depends on what features a person has but may involves taking a medication to protect the heart and blood vessels, surgery for more serious heart or vessel problems associated with the condition, and orthopedic care for problems with the bones and joints.  &lt;/p&gt; 
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Genetics&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;LDS in caused by alterations (mutations) in either the TGFBR1 or TGFBR2 gene.   LDS is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.  This means that individuals with LDS have a 50% chance to pass the gene mutation to each of their children.  The gene mutation causing LDS can be inherited from a parent and other members of the family also have the condition.  However, many individuals with LDS are the first member of their family to have the condition because the mutation occurred spontaneously early in their development.  Even if there is no family history, the children of anyone with LDS have a 50% chance to develop the condition. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Genetic testing can be done to confirm the diagnosis and so other family members can have genetic testing to determine if they have the condition.   &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Family members&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Marfan syndrome is a genetic connective tissue disorder affecting approximately 1 in 5,000 people.  Individuals with Marfan syndrome can have a variety of different features in many different parts of the body including the heart, blood vessels, bones, joints, eyes, lungs and skin. Since Marfan syndrome can affect different people in so many different ways, the making a diagnosis can be challenging.  Diagnosing Marfan syndrome requires consulting specialists familiar with the condition.  Evaluation usually involves an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart), specific eye examination, a genetic consultation and often genetic testing.  &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Treatment for Marfan syndrome depends on what features a person has but may involves taking a medication to protect the heart and blood vessels, surgery for more serious heart problems associated with the condition, corrective lenses or surgery for eye problems and orthopedic care for problems with the bones and joints.  With appropriate medical care, individuals with Marfan syndrome can live long, healthy lives.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Genetics&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Marfan syndrome in caused by abnormalities in the protein fibrillin&#45;1; a key component of connective tissue. Alterations (mutations) in the FBN1 gene cause fibrillin&#45;1 abnormalities and the different features and medical problems associated with Marfan syndrome.  Even though Marfan syndrome is highly variable, everyone with an FBN1 gene mutation develops some features of Marfan syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Marfan syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.  This means that individuals with Marfan have a 50% chance to pass the gene mutation to each of their children.  Most of the time the gene mutation is inherited from a parent and other members of the family have the condition.  However, about 25% of individuals with Marfan are the first member of their family to have the condition because their gene mutation occurred spontaneously very early in their development.  Even if there is no family history, the children of anyone with Marfan syndrome have a 50% chance to have the condition.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#coronary&quot;&gt;Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)&lt;/a&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#pfo&quot;&gt;PFO (Patent Foramen Ovale)&lt;/a&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#asd&quot;&gt;ASD (Atrial Septal Defect)&lt;/a&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#hyper&quot;&gt;Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy&lt;/a&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#valvular&quot;&gt;Valvular Disease&lt;/a&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#pad&quot;&gt;Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD)&lt;/a&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
			&lt;a name=&quot;coronary&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is a disease affecting the arteries surrounding the heart and supplying the heart muscle.  When the arteries are narrowed from the gradual buildup of plaque, the blood supply to the heart muscle is reduced.  The blood supply (and therefore the oxygen supply) to the heart muscle may be adequate when a person is at rest; however, during exertion, the heart muscle will get significantly less oxygen than it needs (ischemia).&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h5&gt;Symptoms&lt;/h5&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;When the imbalance of the oxygen that the muscle needs is significantly less than what it gets, a person may develop chest pain, chest pressure, arm or shoulder ache or pain, shortness of breath with exertion, dizziness, palpitations, indigestion, and/or diaphoresis (sweating).&lt;/p&gt; 
			
			&lt;h5&gt;Diagnosis&lt;/h5&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Non&#45;invasive tests are available to evaluate for CAD, including tests such as EKG, stress test, or cardiac CT angiogram. If your physician is concerned about CAD based on your symptoms or the non&#45;invasive tests, you might then be referred for a cardiac catheterization to evaluate the presence of narrowing in the heart arteries. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Left heart catheterization is a procedure in which the catheter is placed through an artery in your arm or leg, and threaded to the left side of the heart. This is performed to evaluate the pressures inside of your heart chamber and to perform a coronary angiogram.  A coronary angiogram is a part of the left heart catheterization in which contrast or dye is placed in the coronary arteries to visualize whether there are any blockages in the arteries.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h5&gt;Treatment&lt;/h5&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Based on the findings of the coronary angiography, your physicians will then decide on the best course of therapy. These include:&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Medical therapy only
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Medical therapy in addition to performing a coronary angioplasty/stenting procedure; or
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Medical therapy in addition to performing a coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Coronary angioplasty is a procedure performed to widen significantly narrowed coronary arteries.  A tiny balloon built on the tip of a catheter is advanced to the narrowed area and inflated for about 20 seconds, pressing the plaque against the wall of the artery.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;A stent procedure is usually performed after a coronary angioplasty to prevent the plaque from recoiling back and resulting in restenosis (causing the vessel to become narrow again).  The stent is placed by a catheter in the same location that the angioplasty was performed.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery is an open&#45;heart surgical procedure that reroutes new vessels to the heart muscle, “bypassing” the blockage in the coronary artery.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Right heart catheterization is a procedure in which a catheter is placed through a vein in the neck, arm or leg, enabling the measurement of the cardiac filling pressures in the heart and lung. Pressures obtained by the catheter give valuable information for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with pulmonary hypertension, valvular diseases or other medical conditions that might be causing symptoms of shortness of breath. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Cardiac biopsy is a procedure that is used to obtain a small amount of heart tissue for microscopic evaluation to diagnose and treat certain cardiac conditions. This procedure is frequently performed in patients with a heart transplant to assess for possible cardiac rejection after a transplant. At times, this procedure is recommended for patients who have not had a cardiac transplant to assess whether there are certain other conditions which might be affecting the cardiac muscle. The procedure can be performed during right heart catheterization through a vein in the neck or leg with the use of a special biopsy bioptome (a tiny catheter&#45;based implement with a grasping device on the end). &lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			 &lt;a name=&quot;pfo&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;PFO (Patent Foramen Ovale)&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A foramen ovale is a normal opening in the atrial septum of a fetus that allows blood to flow between the atrial chambers of the heart.  Typically, the foramen ovale closes shortly after birth.  In some people, the foramen ovale does not close completely, and a patent foramen ovale (PFO) remains.  A PFO may not cause any symptoms or difficulty. However, in a few people, the PFO may cause concerning symptoms.  In these cases, the PFO can be closed.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h5&gt;Symptoms&lt;/h5&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Many people do not have any symptoms with a PFO and do not require any treatment.  There are a few individuals who develop signs of clots passing across the hole.  This can be manifested through transient ischemic attacks or strokes.  When this occurs, it is important to be evaluated for the need to close the PFO.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h5&gt;Diagnosis&lt;/h5&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A PFO is usually diagnosed using echocardiography (ultrasound of the heart).  During the echocardiogram, echogenic contrast is used to detect abnormal blood flow across the atrial septum.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h5&gt;Treatment&lt;/h5&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Percutaneous PFO closure &#45;  A PFO closure device can be placed across the PFO to seal the hole between the atria.  This is performed in the catheterization lab through an intravenous tube (IV) in the vein. Once the device is placed across the atrial septum, the catheters are removed, the IV site is sealed and a bandage is applied to the IV site. &lt;/p&gt; 
			
			
			 &lt;a name=&quot;asd&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;ASD (Atrial Septal Defect)&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;An atrial septal defect (ASD) is a congenital abnormality caused by the incomplete growth of the atrial septum during fetal development.  The ASD can be very small or large, and there are multiple types of ASDs.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h5&gt;Symptoms&lt;/h5&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Small defects may not cause symptoms and may go undetected until later in life.  If symptoms are present, they might include shortness of breath and/or palpitations. &lt;/p&gt;
			  
			&lt;h5&gt;Diagnosis&lt;/h5&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;An ASD is diagnosed using echocardiography (ultrasound of the heart).  During the echocardiogram, echogenic contrast is used to detect abnormal blood flow across the atrial septum. Some types of ASDs can be associated with abnormal EKG (electrocardiogram) or chest X&#45;ray findings. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h5&gt;Treatment&lt;/h5&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Treatment of the ASD depends on the type, size and location of the ASD, and the presence or absence of associated symptoms. An ASD can be closed using either percutaneous (catheter&#45;based) technique, or through surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Percutaneous ASD closure – An ASD (Atrial Septal Defect) closure device is placed across the ASD to seal the hole between the atria.  This can be achieved in the catheterization lab through an intravenous tube in the vein in the leg.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Surgical ASD closure is required for ASDs that are too large, or if the location of the ASD is not favorable for the use of the percutaneous device.  Surgical closure involves open&#45;heart surgical procedure in which the surgeon puts a patch over the hole to seal the ASD.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			 &lt;a name=&quot;hyper&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a condition in which the heart muscle is abnormally thickened.  The thick muscle is not as flexible as a normal heart, and is unable to relax.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In some cases of HCM, because of the thickening of the heart muscle in the ventricular septum, an obstruction to blood flowing out of the left heart chamber occurs. This condition is called hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM).&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h5&gt;Symptoms &lt;/h5&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Some patients do not have signs and symptoms related to HCM.  Others might have dizziness, lightheadedness, palpitations, high blood pressure and heart failure. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of HOCM include dizziness, chest pain, and a specific type of murmur.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h5&gt;Diagnosis&lt;/h5&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;HCM is usually diagnosed by EKG (electrocardiogram) and echocardiography (ultrasound of the heart). Patients with a family history of HCM are screened. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h5&gt;Treatment &lt;/h5&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;For patients with significant obstruction in the left ventricular outflow tract, your physician may make a decision to perform a procedure to alleviate this obstruction. There are two approaches that may be recommended: 1) percutaneous ethanol ablation, and 2) surgical resection.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Ethanol ablation is a procedure in which ethanol is placed through a catheter in a specific area of the heart to cause abnormally thick muscle of the heart to shrink back to a more normal size.  &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Surgical resection is an open&#45;heart surgery where a surgeon can remove the thickened portion of the ventricular septum to alleviate the left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001243/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NCBI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			
			
			 &lt;a name=&quot;valvular&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;Valvular Disease&lt;/h3&gt; 
			&lt;p&gt;Patients with valvular heart disease are sometimes referred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for evaluation of the severity of the valvular condition and for treatment of the valvular condition. There are different types of valvular heart conditions that patients might develop. These include either leakage or stenosis (narrowing) of the involved heart valve. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h5&gt;Symptoms&lt;/h5&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Symptoms can vary, depending on which heart valve is involved. Often, patients develop shortness of breath, fatigue, lightheadedness, fluid build&#45;up in the lungs, or swelling in the feet. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h5&gt;Diagnosis&lt;/h5&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The diagnosis is made by careful physical examination, EKG (electrocardiogram), chest X&#45;ray, and echocardiography (ultrasound of the heart). &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h5&gt;Treatment&lt;/h5&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The treatment strategy of valvular lesions (e.g., catheter&#45;based or percutaneous interventions vs. surgery) depends on the type of valvular heart condition. For pulmonary valve stenosis/regurgitation, mitral valve stenosis/regurgitation or aortic valve stenosis, there are possible percutaneous treatment options. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;A percutaneous mitral/pulmonary/aortic valvuloplasty is a procedure in which a balloon&#45;tipped catheter is placed through an intravenous tube in the vein and across the stenotic valve.  The balloon is inflated to open the valve, thereby allowing the valve to move more effectively. Novel technologies allow the placement of a new valve mounted on a stent in the pulmonic or aortic valve position to treat leaky pulmonic valves and stenotic aortic valves. Special percutaneous techniques are also being developed for the treatment of leaky mitral valves. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			 &lt;a name=&quot;pad&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD)&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;PAD is a disease affecting the arteries located in different regions of the body (including, but not limited to, arteries in the neck, abdomen, arm, kidney and legs). When the arteries are narrowed from the gradual buildup of plaque, the blood supply to the involved organs is reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h5&gt;Symptoms&lt;/h5&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;When the blockages are severe, the patients might present with symptoms, which vary depending on the location of the arterial blockages and the organs involved. For example, carotid artery occlusions (blockages in blood vessels in the neck) can lead to stroke or transient ischemic attacks and neurologic symptoms. Blockages in the leg arteries might cause pain in the calf or leg when walking, which improves with rest.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h5&gt;Diagnosis&lt;/h5&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;In addition to a complete physical examination, non&#45;invasive tests are available to evaluate for PAD. These include tests such as ankle&#45;brachial index testing or computed tomography or magnetic resonance (CT/MR) angiography. If your physician is concerned about PAD based on your symptoms or the non&#45;invasive tests, you might then be referred for an invasive angiogram to evaluate the presence of narrowing in the peripheral arteries. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h5&gt;Treatment&lt;/h5&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The treatment of PAD depends on the location and severity of the angiographic findings. In addition to aggressive medical therapy that your doctor will recommend for PAD management, percutaneous and surgical treatment options are also available. This may involve percutaneous (catheter&#45;based) balloon angioplasty or stenting, or open surgical treatments.  &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Balloon angioplasty is a procedure performed to widen significantly narrowed arteries.  A tiny balloon built on the tip of a catheter is advanced to the narrowed area and inflated for about 20 seconds, pressing the plaque against the wall of the artery.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;A stent procedure is usually performed after angioplasty to prevent the plaque from recoiling back and resulting in restenosis (causing the vessel to become narrow again).  The stent is placed by a catheter in the same location that the angioplasty was performed.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;The UCSF Divisions of Cardiology provide exceptional care to patients from the entire San Francisco Bay Area, the West Coast and the world.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The UCSF Division of Cardiology has faculty with world&#45;renowned experts in every area of cardiology. Our physicians are not only rated among the top in the Bay Area but are recognized nationally and internationally. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UCSF Medical Center&lt;/b&gt; not only provides high&#45;quality care for unusual or rare conditions, but also excels at management of common conditions. We focus on the prevention of heart disease and encourage healthy heart choices, especially through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ucsfhealth.org/clinics/heart_and_vascular_disease_prevention/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;UCSF Center for Prevention of Heart and Vascular Disease&lt;/a&gt;. Our patients have access to all of the state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art treatments, many of which were either invented or refined by our faculty – such as ablation to treat arrhythmias, cardiac resynchronization to treat heart failure, percutaneous left atrial ligation, and outpatient coronary intervention via the radial artery approach. We have a 24&#45;hour team on call for rapid mobilization to treat heart attacks that ranks amongst the top in the country, a heart failure team leading the nation in keeping patients out of the hospital, a multi&#45;disciplinary heart valve clinic and a world&#45;renowned arrhythmia service.  Our new Cardiovascular Care and Prevention Center, located in Mission Bay, was designed to enhance the patient experience, from the comfortable waiting rooms to the “one&#45;stop shopping” convenience of seeing cardiologists in clinic and  having tests onsite. Patients have access to the latest technologies, including state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art electrophysiology and cardiac catheterization laboratories at the UCSF Medical Center’s Parnassus site. Our new electronic medical record system makes it easy for patients to communicate with their doctors and access test results.  Visit &lt;a href=&quot;/care/clinical/&quot;&gt;Clinical Services&lt;/a&gt; to see all of our programs, &lt;a href=&quot;/care/patients/appointment.html&quot;&gt;Make an Appointment&lt;/a&gt; to find a doctor and &lt;a href=&quot;/care/locations.html&quot;&gt;Clinic Locations&lt;/a&gt; for directions to our clinic.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH)&lt;/b&gt; provides outstanding care to a broad range of patients, including many low&#45;income, immigrant, working poor and indigent residents of San Francisco. Our physicians, nurses and support staff are experienced at evaluating and managing even the most complex cardiac conditions that many our patients present with. SFGH has an excellent program for treating patients with heart attacks, with an on&#45;call team of cardiologists and nurses who can be mobilized within minutes to interrupt the heart attack by opening a blocked artery. We focus on disease prevention that includes smoking cessation programs. We have outpatient cardiology clinics including general cardiology, pacemaker management, treatment of congestive heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. We have the leading experts nationally in managing cardiovascular diseases associated with HIV.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;San Francisco VA Medical Center&lt;/b&gt; provides outstanding care to veterans, and serves as a referral center for the entire West Coast, offering a full range of cardiovascular services to veterans. The UCSF&#45;San Francisco VA Medical Center runs the Pacemaker and ICD Surveillance Program for the Western U.S., and is a regional referral center for heart interventions, cardiac ablation, heart failure and heart surgery. We have a 24&#45;hour team on call for the rapid treatment of heart attacks.  &lt;/p&gt;

Preventing Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation: Left Atrial Appendage Closure ./cardiology/care/patients/stories.html
		</Fname>
		<Tax>1736</Tax>
		<Path>./cardiology/care/patients/stories.html</Path>
		<FileBody>
			
			
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;The UCSF Division of Cardiology is pioneering a way to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, the most common abnormal heart rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;About 2.6 million Americans suffer from atrial fibrillation, which is caused by disorganized electrical activity in the upper chambers, or atria, of the heart. Instead of pumping in an orderly coordinated way, the heart quivers and contracts rapidly and irregularly – reducing the flow of blood to the body.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In addition to symptoms such as fatigue, palpitations and shortness of breath, the most severe consequence of atrial fibrillation is an increased risk of stroke. Because blood is moving more sluggishly than usual, it can become stagnant and start to form clots. If these clots end up in the brain, they can block blood flow and cause a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe that up to 90 percent of these clots form in the left atrial appendage, a hollowed&#45;out, fingerlike outpouching attached to the left atrium, one of the upper chambers of the heart. Usually patients with atrial fibrillation are prescribed blood thinners such as warfarin to prevent these clots from forming. But not all patients can tolerate blood thinners, which can cause severe bleeding – a risk that increases with age. If atrial fibrillation patients are not on blood thinners, their risk of stroke also increases as they age: 15 percent of all strokes are caused by atrial fibrillation, but in patients 70 years and older, more than 20 to 25 percent of strokes are caused by atrial fibrillation.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Creating New Solutions&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“The UCSF Electrophysiology Section, and UCSF in general, has a long track record of being innovative in meeting the needs of patients and giving them options with new clinical procedures and tools,” said Dr. Randall Lee, a UCSF electrophysiologist. “We are very oriented towards patient care and striving for solutions to improve their overall medical care.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lee has been a leader in developing a solution for atrial fibrillation patients at high risk of embolic stroke who are unable to take blood thinners: closing off the left atrial appendage using a minimally invasive approach that does not leave any devices in the body.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Left atrial appendage closure has been performed for decades through surgical techniques, but was highly invasive, requiring open heart surgery to either clip the appendage or tie a knot around it to close it off. The delicate heart tissue could sometimes tear if handled roughly. The far end of the appendage has rod&#45;like formations, similar to the ridges on a banana peel; tying off the appendage too far from the mouth could leave spaces beneath the ridges for blood to get stuck, clot and eventually travel to the brain. Also, since blood was temporarily diverted from the heart and pumped by a heart&#45;lung machine during surgery, it was not possible for surgeons to check whether the closure had leaks.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;More recently, occlusion devices have been developed that can be inserted through catheters. One of these, called the WATCHMAN® Device, opens like an umbrella to cover the opening of the left atrial appendage, and uses hooks to anchor itself into the appendage. However, such devices can potentially perforate the heart, or work their way loose and then migrate through the body.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;How it Works&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Since 2007, Dr. Lee has worked with a Redwood City&#45;based company, SentreHeart, to develop tools and a new procedure for closing the left atrial appendage without surgery or an implanted device. (Full disclosure: Dr. Lee currently serves as a consultant to SentreHeart, and has equity in the company.)&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The process involves inserting a catheter into the chest, carefully puncturing the sac around the heart, called the pericardium. Then a magnet&#45;tipped wire is advanced through the catheter until it touches the tip of the outside of the finger&#45;shaped left atrial appendage. Another such wire is inserted through the femoral artery in the groin, threaded up into the heart, and into the far end of the interior of the left atrial appendage. The two magnets – one inside the tip of the left atrial appendage, one on its surface – snap together, and their attached wires form a “guide rail” which holds the appendage steady, even while the heart continues to beat.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The LARIAT® snare – made of polyester surgical thread and shaped like a lasso, with a slipknot tied at the end – is then slipped along the guide rail to the base of the appendage. Because the electrophysiologist cannot see the left atrial appendage directly and relies on various imaging tools to perform the procedure, he or she inflates a balloon catheter inside the appendage which is easily visible through imaging. The balloon serves as a landmark, ensuring that the LARIAT® snare encircles the mouth of the appendage, rather than leaving space for blood to later pool and clot. The slipknot is tightened, the balloon is deflated and removed, and the LARIAT® snare is cinched tight to completely close off the appendage. A thread cutter snips off the excess thread near the knot. Once all the equipment is removed, all that remains in the body is the tiny slipknot.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Preclinical data shows that the tied&#45;off appendage eventually atrophies and shrivels up, further reducing the chance that blood could pool and form clots.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lee coauthored a recent paper in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology which studied 89 patients in Poland who underwent the procedure. Electrophysiologists were able to successfully close the left atrial appendage for 96 percent of patients. Only 3.3 percent of patients had procedure&#45;related complications, which were caused by the catheterizations rather than the LARIAT® snare itself. After one year, 98 percent of patients who were available for follow&#45;up still had complete closure of their appendage.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;UCSF was one of the first centers to offer the procedure in the United States, and has performed about 30 since 2011. Dr. Lee has trained cardiologists from more than two dozen centers, coaching them as they perform the procedure for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Big potential&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“Dr. Lee did a lot of the initial preclinical work, has really pioneered the whole procedure and is now training others how to do it,” said Dr. Edward P. Gerstenfeld, chief of the Cardiac Electrophysiology and Arrhythmia Service at UCSF Medical Center and the Melvin M. Scheinman Endowed Chair in Cardiology. “It’s good to have him at UCSF, because he’s been a leader in developing this technology.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“For people who just cannot take blood thinners, because they have too much bleeding from them, this can help eliminate or significantly reduce the stroke risk from atrial fibrillation,” said Dr. Gerstenfeld. “Even though there is always some cost and risk to having a procedure done, the hope is that it will improve the quality of life for people afterwards. It will have to be looked at more to see if the risk/benefit ratio is good enough to warrant it being offered to patients as an alternative to blood thinners. You’d have to show that it’s as safe as the [anticoagulation] drugs.  But if it works and is safe, it would have big implications for many patients with atrial fibrillation.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“There is a huge number of people with atrial fibrillation – it’s 6.5 percent of the population over the age of 60, and 10 percent of the population over the age of 80,” said Dr. Gerstenfeld. “If this turns out to be an effective therapy that could be applied to a large percent of the population with atrial fibrillation who are at risk of stroke, it would have a big impact.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Studying the Procedure&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“The procedure clearly meets an unmet need for a very large population,” said Dr. Gregory Marcus, also a UCSF electrophysiologist. “It’s a very innovative approach, and SentreHeart and Dr. Lee have done a great job doing some preliminary work to demonstrate that it’s feasible and likely safe. The next step, which we are now taking, is to really rigorously study it.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Marcus is principal investigator of the coordinating center for the Permanent Ligation Approximation Closure Exclusion III (PLACE III) study, which has received a grant from SentreHeart to perform a multi&#45;center trial. Dr. Marcus is working in partnership with the San Francisco Coordinating Center, a nonprofit research organization with expertise in conducting multicenter studies and clinical trials; it is comprised of researchers from the UCSF Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics and the California Pacific Medical Center Research Institute. He is also the chairman of the PLACE III Steering Committee, a group of experts in electrophysiology and interventional cardiology from around the country that will oversee the study. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The plan is to enroll more than 100 patients at 11 sites in the U.S. and two sites in Europe. Patients will be closely followed for a year to determine the safety and efficacy of the procedure. At one day, 30 days, three months and one year after they undergo left atrial appendage closure using the LARIAT® snare, they will receive transesophageal echocardiograms, which involve inserting a small probe through the mouth and down the esophagus to get a close look at the heart.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;These images will be sent to the core echocardiography lab at UCSF, directed by Dr. Elyse Foster. She, along with Dr. Atif Qasim, a recently recruited faculty member, will help review all of these echocardiograms in detail. Any patients who experience serious adverse events, such as death, stroke, or a heart&#45;related hospitalization, will have a team of independent physicians review their charts to determine whether these were related to the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Beyond learning whether the procedure is safe and effective, researchers will also have an opportunity to discover more about heart function, atrial fibrillation and other diseases. In addition to supporting the follow&#45;up imaging, the grant is funding the collection of serum and plasma from patients during each visit. These biosamples will be sent to UCSF; if Dr. Marcus is able to raise additional funds, these samples will be analyzed to discover more about heart function and disease.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“This will be a very rich data set,” said Dr. Marcus. “It’s rare to have transesophageal echocardiograms done multiple times in the same patient, according to a preset protocol. We’ll also have a repository of data samples from this selected, very high&#45;risk population.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;For example, researchers could examine whether eliminating the left atrial appendage affects clotting behavior throughout the body. “It’s likely that clots that form in the left atrial appendage are in communication with the rest of the blood pool,” said Dr. Marcus. “When you turn on a clotting factor, that tells the blood, ‘Hey! It’s time to clot now.’ It could be that those leak out and systematically affect clotting. There is some data to suggest that atrial fibrillation patients are more prone to clot, even in peripheral blood (such as blood drawn from the arm). It would be very interesting to see if we can reduce that if we get rid of the appendage. Because we’re going to have serial samples from the same people, we will be able to look at changes in those clotting factors.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“We’re also interested in the cause&#45;and&#45;effect relationship between inflammation and atrial fibrillation,” said Dr. Marcus. “We and others have contributed to this literature, showing that inflammation can cause atrial fibrillation, and atrial fibrillation can also increase inflammation. We also know that inflammation seems to be important in many other diseases – not only cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial infarctions (heart attacks), but also probably cancer and diabetes. So if you can reduce inflammation, perhaps that can lead to other benefits that would not otherwise be expected.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Marcus and the rest of the steering committee will review proposals from other researchers at UCSF and around the world who would like to access the PLACE III data to conduct their own research. “This is a very valuable collection, and will be a fruitful repository for other investigations,” said Dr. Marcus.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In addition to the PLACE III study, Dr. Marcus and Dr. Lee are establishing a national registry, and will invite all patients in the U.S. and Europe who undergo the LARIAT® procedure to enroll. Dr. Marcus hopes to have several thousand patients sign up to track long&#45;term success, complications and outcomes of the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Pioneering a Combined Procedure&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;UCSF is also leading the way in studying whether pairing the left atrial appendage closure with another procedure can lead to improved outcomes. While some atrial fibrillation patients go in and out of normal heart rhythm, most remain in atrial fibrillation all the time. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The body’s natural pacemaker is located in the right atrium, and emits the electrical signal that initiates each heartbeat and causes the heart muscle to contract in a smooth, coordinated manner. However, “rogue” electrical signals can originate from other locations in the heart, including both atria, the pulmonary veins – which carry blood from the lungs to the left atrium – and the left atrial appendage. These disruptive electrical signals wreak havoc, causing the heart to move in a disorganized, ineffectual manner.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“The gold standard for eliminating atrial fibrillation is the Cox&#45;Maze procedure,” said Dr. Nitish Badhwar. This is a surgical procedure that involves cutting and sewing the atria in a maze&#45;like pattern. Because the scar tissue which forms on the heart from this procedure does not conduct electricity well, it interrupts the flow of disruptive electrical signals. The procedure has an 80 to 90 percent success rate in curing atrial fibrillation. “With the Cox&#45;Maze procedure, the removal of the left atrial appendage is an integral part of the procedure,” said Dr. Badhwar, since abnormal electrical signals can also originate in the appendage.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;As catheter&#45;based procedures have improved, they offer an effective, less invasive way to treat atrial fibrillation. Dr. Melvin M. Scheinman, the Walter H. Shorenstein Endowed Chair in Cardiology, performed the first catheter ablation in humans at UCSF in 1981, and the use of this procedure to treat atrial fibrillation was first described in 1998.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Electrophysiologists insert a catheter through the groin, arm or neck, and thread tiny devices up to the heart. After identifying where “rogue” electrical signals are originating in the heart, they use radiofrequency energy or other methods to strategically ablate, or destroy, heart tissue. Similar to the Cox&#45;Maze procedure, catheter ablation electrically isolates “rogue” signals, creating a line of scar tissue that does not conduct electricity. However, ablating the left atrial appendage can be risky, since the tissue is more delicate than the rest of the heart, and ablation can sometimes perforate it.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Left atrial appendage closure offers what could be a better solution. Since 2011, Dr. Badhwar and Dr. Lee have begun offering a two&#45;part combined procedure for patients with persistent atrial fibrillation. They first perform the left atrial appendage closure using the LARIAT® procedure. Because the appendage atrophies, it no longer emits “rogue” electrical signals that can contribute to atrial fibrillation. About a month later, Drs. Badhwar and Lee then perform catheter&#45;based ablation of the left atrium, reducing or eliminating “rogue” signals originating in the pulmonary veins or atria.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;So far, they have performed this combined procedure in about 10 patients at UCSF, as well as another 10 patients at other centers in the U.S. “Ideally, I would like to see outcomes at one year, but preliminary results look very good,” said Dr. Badhwar. “More than half of patients are staying in normal rhythm, which for this group would not be expected if they just had the ablation or the appendage closure.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
			The main reasons that patients would not be good candidates for either this combined procedure or the LARIAT® procedure by itself would be because they had previous open heart surgery – the resulting scar tissue makes it difficult to insert a catheter through the pericardium – or patients whose left atrial appendage is located in a difficult&#45;to&#45;reach position. “But anytime you’re considering doing any procedure on patients with persistent atrial fibrillation, I think they would be candidates for doing this combined procedure,” said Dr. Badhwar. “Our hope is that if we can replicate the Cox&#45;Maze procedure through catheter&#45;based methods, then we can have similar kinds of results, with a less invasive procedure.”

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Our experts are available to provide consultation for all aspects of cardiovascular care and prevention.  We strive to provide rapid, seamless referrals with an eye towards customer service.  We have several locations throughout the Bay Area and an easy mechanism for referrals.  Our new electronic medical record allows for rapid communication of findings and follow&#45;up.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
			UCSF has world&#45;class expertise in every area of cardiology, and is an outstanding resource for both patients and referring physicians. We routinely receive referrals from all over the Bay Area, the country and the world.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The recent opening of the Cardiovascular Care and Prevention Center at Mission Bay provides an opportunity to create an even more user&#45;friendly experience. Outpatient cardiovascular services are now provided in the spacious clinic on the ground floor of the Smith Cardiovascular Research Institute building, conveniently located near downtown San Francisco, the Bay Bridge and just 20 minutes from the airport. Valet parking is available, and the Center is located near Highways 101 and 280, the MUNI T light rail line and UCSF shuttles.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Patients can complete blood draws and diagnostic tests onsite, often the same day as their consultation. We have the ability to provide rapid consultations when necessary. In addition, we continue to run practices on the Parnassus campus, Mount Zion campus, Chinatown and in Marin. 
			
			&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;a href=&quot;/care/physicians/refer.html&quot;&gt;Refer a Patient&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;a href=&quot;/care/locations.html&quot;&gt;See our Clinic Locations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;We offer a full range of patient testing at our downtown  (Mission Bay) facility, including echocardiography, vascular studies to evaluate for carotid disease, aortic aneurysms and peripheral artery disease, ECG, stress testing and nuclear cardiovascular studies. There are even showers for patients who need to freshen up after a stress test before leaving the clinic. In addition, since all &lt;a href=&quot;/care/patients/test.html&quot;&gt;testing&lt;/a&gt; is performed on site, we are able to offer rapid consultation for any positive test in all subspecialties. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In response to feedback we gathered from community medical physicians, we hired referral coordinators to help new patients navigate the UCSF system and to facilitate communication among patients, referring physicians and UCSF cardiologists. Our newly implemented electronic medical record system makes it easy for patients to communicate with UCSF physicians and to access their test results and other information. This also enables rapid communication (usually within 24 hours) to referring physicians. We also have a &lt;a href=&quot;/care/physicians/oncall.html&quot;&gt;cardiologist available&lt;/a&gt; for rapid consultation for urgent patient issues.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;For more emergent and inpatient issues, we have cardiologists on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  We have established an “always open” cardiovascular transfer bed to immediately accept critically ill patients on transfer from another hospital. To reach an on&#45;call cardiologist, see &lt;a href=&quot;/care/physicians/oncall.html&quot;&gt;On&#45;Call Cardiologist&lt;/a&gt;.  To transfer a patient, see &lt;a href=&quot;/care/physicians/transfer.html&quot;&gt;Patient Transfer&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Our fellowship opportunities offer the highest&#45;level training in cardiovascular medicine and its subspecialties, balancing superb clinical training with outstanding research opportunities.  Our unique multi&#45;campus program covers the spectrum of patient populations, providing exposure to a wide array of cardiovascular disease. Fellows work closely with world&#45;class clinicians, physician&#45;scientists and scientists who have a passion for teaching and training. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p&gt;UCSF offers outstanding fellowship programs that train future leaders in cardiology to provide excellent patient care, conduct cutting&#45;edge basic and clinical research, and teach the next generation of cardiologists.  &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;We have several training programs that include general &lt;a href=&quot;/education/programs/general.html&quot;&gt;Cardiology Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; as well as subspecialty training in &lt;a href=&quot;/education/programs/electro.html&quot;&gt;Electrophysiology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/education/programs/interventional.html&quot;&gt;Interventional Cardiology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/education/programs/heart.html&quot;&gt;Advanced Heart Failure/Transplant and Pulmonary Hypertension&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;/education/programs/echo.html&quot;&gt;Advanced Cardiac Imaging&lt;/a&gt;. We also offer several research fellowships and post&#45;doctoral fellowships.  &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Cardiology fellows work closely with experts in every area of cardiology, who all share a passion for teaching. Fellows rotate through the three hospital campuses of UCSF, and have the opportunity to care for an unparalleled breadth of patients. These include: &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
			At &lt;a href=&quot;/care/locations.html&quot;&gt;UCSF Medical Center&lt;/a&gt; (Parnassus/Mount Zion/Mission Bay) trainees are exposed to a tertiary care patient population.  These patients range from those with common cardiovascular diseases to the most challenging illnesses referred from around the country and the world. Fellows participate in the full range of clinical services and programs from general cardiology, to coronary and peripheral interventions, electrophysiology, advanced heart failure, heart transplant, pulmonary hypertension, advanced cardiovascular imaging and adult congenital heart disease patients. 
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;a href=&quot;/care/locations.html&quot;&gt;San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH)&lt;/a&gt; serves as the city and county hospital of San Francisco. Because SFGH cares for a large underserved population, including a sizable immigrant population, our trainees see patients with advanced and often previously undiagnosed and untreated complex cardiovascular diseases and conditions that are rarely seen elsewhere in the United States. Also, SFGH is a level I Trauma Center, affording the fellows an opportunity to care for patients with cardiac trauma.  
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
			The &lt;a href=&quot;/care/locations.html&quot;&gt;San Francisco Veterans Administration Medical Center (SF VAMC)&lt;/a&gt; cares for veterans from the San Francisco Bay Area and the Western U.S. It is a referral center for Electrophysiology, Interventional Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery.  Trainees are exposed to veterans with a wide range of cardiovascular disease.
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Fellows also conduct research, and are mentored by world&#45;class scientists and clinician&#45;educators whose interests range from basic molecular cardiology, to translational research to cardiovascular epidemiology. In addition to conducting clinical and translational research on the aforementioned three hospital campuses, the fellows have the opportunity to conduct basic and translational research at two renowned cardiovascular institutes at UCSF, &lt;a href=&quot;http://cvri.ucsf.edu/&quot;&gt;Cardiovascular Research Institute&lt;/a&gt; (directed by Dr. Shaun Coughlin) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gladstone.ucsf.edu/gladstone/site/gicd/&quot;&gt;UCSF’s Gladstone Cardiovascular Institute&lt;/a&gt; (directed by Dr. Deepak Srivastava). The new Smith Cardiovascular Research Building at Mission Bay houses not only the Cardiovascular Care and Prevention Center, but also four floors of research laboratories, and was designed to facilitate translation between basic and clinical research.  &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Optional: Comments from Current Fellows)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“In order to become a good clinician, you have to see a wide variety of patients. Even in the first weeks, my fund of knowledge increased rapidly. Also, everyone from the attending physicians to the second&#45;year fellows has been very supportive, which creates a really nice work environment.”
			&lt;br /&gt;
			– Dr. Daniel Brenner&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“The breadth of pathology we’ve been able to witness has been astonishing… I’ve seen more cases of stress cardiomyopathy in the last two months than I saw in three years of residency.”
			&lt;br /&gt;
			– Dr. Stephen Waldo&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“Already, I have learned so much, even more than I expected. The faculty are great teachers, and are very supportive and enthusiastic.”
			&lt;br /&gt;
			– Dr. Annie Narla&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“Between the three hospitals and the Cardiovascular Research Institute, there is no shortage of potential mentors to help guide a career in research and academic medicine.”
			&lt;br /&gt;
			– Dr. Babak Nazer&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Photo credit Elisabeth Fall.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;The UCSF Division of Cardiology provides superb clinical care and leads pioneering research to improve treatment of cardiac disease. What perhaps fewer people realize is that UCSF is also one of the country’s leading training programs for the next generation of cardiologists.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;We seek to turn out future leaders in cardiology – people who will lead the way not only in patient care, but in advancing knowledge in the field,&quot; said Dr. Michael Crawford, who directs the UCSF Cardiology Fellowship Program and holds the Lucie Stern Chair in Cardiology.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Each year, UCSF’s program receives about 400 applications, interviews about 50 candidates, and selects six fellows. These outstanding young physicians, who have all completed four years of medical school and three years of internal medicine residency training, then spend an additional three years training at UCSF. During the first two years, fellows complete month&#45;long rotations in various areas of cardiology, such as the Coronary Care Unit, interventional cardiology and echocardiography. The third year is devoted to research, whether it is working in a basic science laboratory, learning how to conduct clinical research, or some other area of discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Key Strengths&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;One of the core strengths of UCSF’s fellowship program is that trainees rotate through three different hospitals – UCSF Medical Center, which receives referrals of some of the most complex patients in the western US; San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center (SFGH), a Level I trauma center which also cares for immigrants, low&#45;income patients and other vulnerable populations; and the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center (SFVAMC).&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;We provide a broad spectrum of experience that you wouldn’t get if you did a fellowship in a community hospital,&quot; said Dr. Crawford. &quot;We think it’s important for somebody to really see the breadth of cardiology.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Trainees also have access to state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art training technology at the Kanbar Center for Simulation, Clinical Skills and Telemedicine Education, located on the Parnassus campus. For example, experienced third&#45;year fellows use lifelike mannequins to teach first&#45;year fellows how to perform a pericardiocentesis, in which a cardiologist delicately inserts a needle through the chest wall and into the sac around the heart to drain excess fluid. This is a relatively rare procedure, but requires considerable practice to do well. &quot;By practicing on a mannequin, they can take advantage of modern simulation technology to improve their expertise and confidence,&quot; said Dr. Crawford.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;During the first few months of fellowship, the Division of Cardiology puts together a &quot;summer school,&quot; in which new fellows attend extra didactic sessions to get up to speed. During those initial months, second&#45;year fellows also are on call to provide round&#45;the&#45;clock backup for first&#45;year fellows who have questions, and the cardiology faculty are always available.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Another strength of the fellowship program is the world&#45;renowned cardiology faculty at UCSF. &quot;We have excellent faculty at all three hospitals – people who are at the top of their fields – and they like to impart their knowledge to others,&quot; said Dr. Crawford. &quot;Fellowship is an apprenticeship type of learning experience, and perhaps 85 percent of it is on&#45;the&#45;job training. When you’re working with really fine clinicians, it makes a huge difference.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;UCSF is also a research powerhouse; UCSF School of Medicine is the nation’s top recipient of funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the University is known for its culture of collaboration and multidisciplinary investigations. &quot;We have a plethora of research opportunities for fellows, not only in cardiology, but in the institution in general,&quot; said Dr. Crawford. &quot;We let the fellows pick whatever research area they want to work in, which makes us attractive to the top fellowship candidates in the country.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Those research opportunities span the gamut from laboratory&#45;based investigations to translational and clinical research. &quot;Our ability to provide fellows with more in&#45;depth research experience, especially clinical research, has improved,&quot; said Dr. Elyse Foster, medical director of the Non&#45;Invasive Cardiology Laboratories at UCSF Medical Center, who has served on the faculty since 1989. &quot;Nowadays it’s impossible to get funding for clinical research without getting a masters or at least a certificate in clinical research, and giving our fellows the time to get this advanced training has made a huge difference for them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;UCSF also offers advanced fellowships for trainees who wish to develop additional expertise in particular areas of cardiology. &quot;Within general cardiology, several distinct sub&#45;subspecialties have developed,&quot; said Dr. Nelson Schiller, who has served on the faculty since 1973 and founded the Non&#45;Invasive Cardiology Laboratory and the Adult Congenital Heart Disease Clinic at UCSF Medical Center. &quot;The three&#45;year core fellowship provides intense exposure to all sub&#45;sub areas, but owing to the complexity and importance of each subdivision, board certification is now required beyond general certification.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Some of these sub&#45;subspecialty areas include electrophysiology, interventional cardiology and advanced heart failure and transplant fellowships. More recently, UCSF established an advanced cardiac imaging fellowship, which includes advanced training in echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), nuclear medicine and computed tomography (CT) scans, as well as an advanced fellowship in adult congenital heart disease. &quot;Our advanced training has always been unique in that it requires sub&#45;sub fellows to spend half of the time mastering clinical skills and the other half in research,&quot; said Dr. Schiller. &quot;It is not a stretch that this program has been responsible for our leadership role in research and in the academic success of fellows that follow this pathway.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Supporting Outstanding Education&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Although education is one of the core missions of UCSF, it is something of an unfunded mandate. While patient fees cover the cost of clinical care, and research grants from the NIH and other agencies fund research, there is no similar funding source for education. Medicare pays hospitals like UCSF Medical Center to employ residents and fellows, which essentially covers their salaries; the VA pays for trainees’ salaries at SFVAMC, and the City and County of San Francisco covers these costs at SFGH. However, the time that faculty members spend educating residents and fellows lacks a consistent funding source; the State of California’s support of UCSF has dropped to about 5 percent of the overall budget.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;Having the time to really train people in a health care system that increasingly wants efficiency and high patient throughput is challenging,&quot; said Dr. Crawford. &quot;And research funding has become so competitive that faculty find it challenging to spend a lot of time teaching, because they worry that they won’t get their next grant funded if they’re not productive. The fellowship program is a resource&#45;intensive operation which takes a lot of time and money, and which isn’t well&#45;funded by a dedicated source.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Because Medicare, the VA and the City and County of San Francisco only pay for a minimal amount of trainee staffing, privately endowed fellowships actually make it possible for UCSF to have six fellowship positions each year. Additional private funding could create an additional fellowship position at SFGH, as well as seed money for fellows to develop research experience. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s hard to get research funding for fellows, because many of them are not yet experienced at it,&quot; said Dr. Crawford. &quot;By funding fellows’ research, it would give them more of a chance to see if they’re going to be good at it. We’ve had fellows who weren’t sure about research who did a project, loved it, and became very good researchers.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Better Care, Now and Later&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;Fellows are an important part of the team that takes care of the patient,&quot; said Dr. Crawford, noting that as an academic hospital, UCSF Medical Center is lucky to have outstanding residents and fellows as part of that team. &quot;Without trainees, you rely solely on nurses and the faculty physician who is at home to take care of you at night. But with fellows and residents, we have people in the hospital 24/7 who know about you and are there to troubleshoot in the middle of the night. Sometimes these trainees come up with an idea that the faculty didn’t think about. It pays off for the patient to have more than one brain working on their issue.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Fellows also keep faculty members on their toes. &quot;I get back so much more than I give,&quot; said Dr. Foster. &quot;As a teacher, it stimulates you to constantly think and learn. It’s wonderful to work with young people, and to see those ‘Aha!’ moments when things make sense. But teaching also makes you so much better at what you do – there is a depth of understanding and knowledge that you need in order to teach it well that goes beyond what one needs for clinical practice alone.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;About two&#45;thirds of the graduating fellows continue in academic medicine, pursuing some combination of clinical care, research and educating trainees. The other third pursue a wide range of other endeavors, including private practice, industry, global health and public policy. A few examples include:&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dr. Hal V. Barron: former executive vice president of Genentech; currently president of research and development at Calico LLC, a research and development biotech company
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dr. Uday N. Kumar: founder, president and CEO, Element Science, Inc., which is developing a cost&#45;effective wearable therapeutic device that mitigates sudden cardiac death risk, and founder of several other medical device companies.
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dr. Whittemore Tingley: medical director, clinical development, Genentech&lt;/ul&gt;
			
			&quot;These are very talented people,&quot; said Dr. Crawford. &quot;Most of them are going to be future leaders who come up with new ways to treat patients that will be important for the next generation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h2&gt;Fellowships&lt;/h2&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;
			The UCSF Echocardiography Fellowship Program is housed within the Adult Echocardiography Laboratory of the UCSF Medical Center located in the Moffitt&#45;Long Hospital. Annually, the lab performs over 15,000 echocardiograms, including transthoracic, transesophageal and stress (exercise or pharmacologic) studies.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;ul style=&quot;margin&#45;bottom:&#45;10px;margin&#45;top:10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;ADVANCED ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY FELLOWSHIP&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			[Prerequisite: Completion of cardiology fellowship]&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;NOTE: We have filled all positions starting July 2018. Please check back January 2018 for application materials for a July 2019 start.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The Advanced Echocardiography fellowships is designed to help fellows hone their clinical skills in echocardiography and advanced methodology including: 3&#45;dimensional imaging, strain imaging, structural echo, and contrast echocardiography. Fellows will have the opportunity to play an integral role in our structural echo procedures (such as TAVR, MitraClip, ASD closures, valve in valve) with opportunities to learn on the latest, state of the art imaging equipment. Additional clinical skills are developed in the arena of adult congenital heart disease by rotating through congenital clinics.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The fellow will have dedicated time for research and will be expected to work on independent research projects under the mentorship of one or more faculty. Prior fellows have had success in developing their own protocols, getting IRB approval, recruiting subjects, and generating and analyzing data. There are also numerous ongoing research projects that fellows can be integrated into. Research is fostered through biweekly meetings to review progress obtain feedback. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Finally, teaching and scholastic skills are enhanced as fellows assume increasing responsibility throughout the year for running several of our core echo conferences and teaching first year fellows. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The clinical training program is designed to provide the fellow with level III training in clinical echocardiography as defined by the American College of Cardiology and the American Society of Echocardiography, provided that a general cardiology fellowship has been completed as well. Upon completion of the echo fellowship, qualified participants are eligible to sit for the examination of Special Competency in Echocardiography (ASCeXAM).  Upon successful passing of the examination, the applicant will receive certification as a Level III Echocardiographer as determined by the National Board of Echocardioography.

			&lt;ul style=&quot;margin&#45;bottom:&#45;10px;margin&#45;top:10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;ADVANCED NON&#45;INVASIVE CARDIOVASCULAR IMAGING FELLOWSHIP&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			[Prerequisite: Completion of cardiology fellowship or completion of Radiology Residency (including medical internship year) at ACGME&#45;accredited institutions]&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The UCSF Advanced Imaging Fellowship was developed in response to the need for graduates of cardiovascular fellowships to have training in the new modalities of CMR and CCT and to provide radiologists with further training in Advanced Cardiac Imaging. A collaborative Advanced Non&#45;invasive Cardiovascular Imaging Fellowship allows trainees in Cardiology to be exposed to the expertise in Radiology (such as technical expertise, approach to interpretation and imaging modalities not available in Cardiology) and trainees in Radiology to be exposed to expertise in Cardiology (such as clinical expertise, patient access, broad range of diagnostic approaches, and imaging modalities not available in Radiology). Most importantly, the collaborative fellowship creates opportunities for extensive clinical and research collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

			[Prerequisite: Completion of internal medicine, anesthesia residency or critical care fellowship]&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In certain instances, we will consider qualified applicants who have not completed a cardiology fellowship.  We welcome highly qualified applicants who have strong research and clinical interests in the discipline of echocardiography.  The echocardiography training fellowship is not accredited by ACGME. While applicants will likely meet Level III training requirements in echocardiography, certification by the National Board of Echocardiography is currently limited to cardiologists and anesthesiologists. The research opportunities are similar to those offered in the Advanced Echocardiography Fellowship.  These fellows will be exposed to the identical curriculum, including academic conferences. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;h2&gt;HOW TO APPLY: &lt;/h2&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;We have filled all positions for 2018&#45;19. Please check this website January 2018 for 2019&#45;20 application materials.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

			The adult Cardiology Fellowship Training Program of the University of California, San Francisco is fully integrated among its three core hospitals: Moffitt/Long Hospital, Veterans Affairs Hospital, and San Francisco General Hospital. UCSF participates in the Subspecialty Fellows Matching Program. The program consists of 24 months of clinical training. The sequence of training will be 2 clinical years followed by a minimum of one or more years of research training. The research years are funded by various research fellowships (i.e., NIH training grants, the NIH&#45;funded Program of Excellence in Molecular Biology of the Cardiovascular Research Institute, individual NIH Fellowships, Heart Association Fellowships, Pharmaceutical Fellowships, etc.). This funding is obtained by selecting a preceptor and project and submitting the appropriate proposals. Clinical training is funded by Hospital/Departmental resources. Fellows in good standing are guaranteed 4 years of funding.
			                    &lt;br&gt;
			&lt;br&gt;
			The current stipend for Cardiology Fellows in the clinical portion of their training is approximately $65,211.00 for the first year and $66,676.00 for the second year. There is an additional housing allowance of $11,000 this academic year.

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;
			The University of California, San Francisco training program in interventional cardiology is a one year ACGME&#45;accredited program with an optional non&#45;ACGME year and that is affiliated with the ABIM accredited General Cardiology Fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Over 800 interventions are performed annually at the two principle catheterization laboratories, the UCSF Moffitt Adult Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory and the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In accordance with our goal of training future academicians, the program has an emphasis on developing an active area of research interest in addition to providing outstanding training in basic and advanced techniques in interventional cardiology.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The first year is primarily focused on research, with clinical time to develop a foundation of knowledge and skills required for the following year. Active areas of research include clinical, animal and basic science projects, and fellows are mentored in all areas including study design, grant writing, institutional review board application in addition to presenting work at conferences, meetings and in publication.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;P&gt;During the second non&#45;ACGME year, the fellow will acquire expertise as primary operator on coronary interventions, ethanol septal ablations, patent foramen ovale (PFO) and atrial septal defect (ASD) closures, and valvuloplasties in addition to learning to teach general cardiology fellows diagnostic cardiac catheterization. All facilities use state of the art equipment and techniques, including flat&#45;panel imaging, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), fractional flow reserve (FFR), intracardiac echo (ICE), rheolytic thrombectomy, as well as &quot;niche&quot; techniques such as rotational atherectomy. As a dedicated site to primary coronary intervention for acute myocardial infarction, trainees have broad exposure to the entire spectrum of coronary disease, including chronic stable coronary artery disease, chronic total occlusion (CTO), acute coronary syndromes and ST&#45;elevation MI. A thorough curriculum, including academic conferences, literature reviews, review of unusual cases/presentation has been a tradition at UCSF. The second year will be split between the two principle catheterization laboratories, the UCSF Moffitt Hospital Adult Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory and the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory.
			&lt;/P&gt;
			&lt;P&gt;The UCSF Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory is performing a full range of diagnostic and interventional peripheral angiographic procedures, including studies of the subclavian arteries, renal arteries, abdominal aorta, iliac and femoral arteries. For carotid interventions, we have established an agreement with our colleagues in interventional radiology and vascular surgery to perform joint interventions. In addition, in collaboration with Radiology and Vascular Surgery, we are developing a program where the interventional fellows can participate in the non&#45;invasive interpretation of various peripheral vascular imaging modalities such as ultrasound, CT, and MRI.
			&lt;/P&gt;
			&lt;P&gt;We already filled our fellowship position starting July 1, 2018. We will be accepting applications for a July 1, 2019 start in ERAS.&lt;/P&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;APPLICATIONS:&lt;/b&gt; We will be accepting applications through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.erasfellowshipdocuments.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ERAS, Electronic Residency Application Service&lt;/a&gt; in the December application cycle. The ERAS phone is (215) 966&#45;3940. &lt;u&gt;We do not accept paper applications&lt;/u&gt;. The deadline for completed applications is &lt;b&gt;January 31, 2018&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;The UCSF Cardiology Training Program is designed to train academically oriented cardiologists.  In addition to rigorous training in clinical cardiology, fellows are required to perform research and to participate in other academic activities such as teaching and conferences.  In general, fellows complete 2 core clinical years and 2 research years.  The 2 research years may include clinical activities appropriate to the research or specialized training in selected subspecialties of cardiology.  A continuity clinic is required for at least 3 of the 4 years.  During this training it is anticipated that fellows will apply for grants and other research support to initiate their careers in academic cardiology.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The Cardiology Training Program is organized to provide training and supervised experience in the evaluation and management of a wide variety of acute and chronic cardiovascular disorders.  The main categories consist of chronic coronary disease, heart failure including heart transplant, cardiac arrhythmias, acute coronary syndromes including myocardial infarction, lipid disorders, hypertension and hypertensive heart disease, valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathy, pericardial disease, pulmonary hypertension, inflammatory and infectious heart diseases including endocarditis, and adult congenital heart disease.  Fellows rotate through UCSF Medical Center, San Francisco General Hospital, and the San Francisco VA Medical Center, ensuring their exposure to sufficient numbers of all forms of heart disease.  The broad exposure to different types of patients and different approaches to patient management ensures that the fellow will be able to acquire the competency of a specialist in all aspects of cardiology.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Clinical Experience&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The minimum 24 months of clinical training includes inpatient and outpatient experiences.  A minimum of 4 months is spent in the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory, 6 months in noninvasive cardiology, including 3 months of echocardiography, 2 months of nuclear cardiology, and one month of other imaging noninvasive imaging cardiac tests (exercise stress testing, ECG interpretation, interpretation of ambulatory ECG recordings).  There is a minimum of 9 months of non&#45;laboratory clinical practice activity, including consultations, cardiac care units, and the postoperative care of cardiac surgery patients. There are two months of electrophysiology. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Acquisition of Technical and Other Skills&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The program is designed to provide sufficient experience for fellows to acquire skills in the performance and interpretation of the history and physical examination, basic and advanced cardiac life support, elective cardioversion, bedside right heart catheterization, transvenous and transcutaneous cardiac pacing, right and left heart catheterization, including coronary arteriography (minimum 100), exercise stress testing (minimum 50), the performance and interpretation of echocardiography (minimum 150) including transesophageal studies, pericardiocentesis, programming and follow&#45;up surveillance of permanent pacemakers and internal cardiac defibrillators, and cardiac rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The program provides opportunities for fellows to acquire experience in the performance (and where applicable) interpretation of intracardiac electrophysiologic studies, intra&#45;aortic balloon counterpulsation, coronary balloon angioplasty, stent placement, and other selected interventional procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The program also provides sufficient experience for fellows to acquire skill in the interpretation of chest x&#45;rays, ECG’s (minimum 3,500), ambulatory ECG recordings (minimum 75), and radionuclide studies of myocardial function and perfusion.  Fellows are also provided guidance in learning and interpreting the cardiovascular literature.&lt;/p&gt;
			 
			
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Formal Instruction&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The program provides instruction in the following areas:
			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Basic science, including cardiovascular anatomy, cardiovascular physiology, cardiovascular metabolism, molecular biology of the cardiovascular system, and cardiovascular pathology.
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cardiovascular pharmacology, including drug metabolism, adverse effects, therapeutic guidelines, the effects of aging, relative costs of treatment, and the effects of non&#45;cardiovascular drugs on cardiovascular function.
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prevention of cardiovascular disease, including the principles of epidemiology and biostatistics, hypertension, lipid disorders, diabetes, and other coronary risk factors.
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The evaluation and management of patients with coronary artery disease, including all of its manifestations and complications, arrhythmias, hypertensive heart disease, cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease, pericardial heart disease, pulmonary heart disease, including pulmonary embolism, peripheral vascular disease, cerebral vascular disease, heart disease in pregnancy, adult congenital heart disease, and cardiac trauma.
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Instruction in the management of acute and chronic heart failure, acute coronary syndromes, including acute myocardial infarction, acute and chronic arrhythmias, preoperative assessment and postoperative management, cardiac transplant evaluation and management, and the management of geriatric patients with heart disease.
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Instruction in other diagnostic techniques including magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and positron emission tomography.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Conferences&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Each of the three UCSF affiliated hospitals has excellent facilities, a strong educational environment and a regular schedule of cardiology conferences.  Cardiology Grand Rounds/Basic Science conference are held weekly, except during the summer, at UCSFMC, for all faculty and fellows at the three hospitals.  Each fellow attends a minimum of one major national cardiology meeting per year (American Heart Association or American College of Cardiology) during the first two years.  Fellows also have opportunities to attend local cardiology meetings and conferences. Other conferences include weekly cardiac catheterization conference at each of the three hospitals; a monthly journal club, the core curriculum conference and a fellows clinical conference.&lt;/p&gt; 
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Professional and Ethical Behavior&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The Division of Cardiology is committed to a culture of professionalism which places the needs of the patient first, maintains a commitment to scholarship, to continuous quality improvement, and fosters a spirit of collaboration among colleagues.  Fellows learn these attitudes from mentors and role&#45;model clinicians.  The training program is committed to maintaining a high ethical standard, a spirit of collegiality, integrity, respect, compassion, professional responsibility and accountability, courtesy, and sensitivity to patient needs and comfort.  Fellows are evaluated in these areas, and they are considered to be an integral part of the training program.&lt;/p&gt;

			                    completing a cardiology fellowship at UCSF, joined its faculty
			                    in 1973 and is now Professor of Medicine, Radiology and Anesthesiology
			                    and holder of the John J Sampson&#45;Lucie Stern Endowed Chair
			                    in Cardiology. In 1972 he founded the Echocardiography Laboratory
			                    and served as its director for 25 years; he continues to
			                    have an active role in this laboratory as a senior attending
			                    and fellowship mentor. Since the opening of the laboratory,
			                    Dr. Schiller has trained over 100 cardiologists as research/clinicians
			                    in echocardiography. His clinical interests encompass the
			                    many applications of cardiac ultrasound techniques as well
			                    as an active practice in general cardiology(Moffitt/Long
			                    Hospital Faculty Practice and In&#45;patient service attending).
			                    In 1985, Dr. Schiller founded&amp;nbsp; the Adult Congenital
			                    Heart Disease Service and directed it through its first decade;
			                    he continues to have an active role as an attending.&amp;nbsp; In
			                    1980, in collaboration with Cardiovascular Anesthesia, Dr.
			                    Schiller performed the first intraoperative transesophageal
			                    echocardiogram (TEE). TEE has since become the standard of
			                    care for intraoperative monitoring of high risk cardiac surgery
			                    and the repair of valvular and congenital heart diseases.
			                    He is currently director of echocardiography research at
			                    the San Francisco Veteran's Hospital and, for the last 26
			                    years a member of the Cardiovascular Research Institute.
			                    For ten years (1993&#45;2003), Dr. Schiller served as an Associate
			                    Editor of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology
			                    and currently serves in the same capacity for the Journal
			                    of Cardiac Failure and Up to Date. He also serves on several
			                    national cardiovasculasr boards and committees. His research
			                    interests center around the noninvasive quantitation of left
			                    ventricular and left atrial function, valvular diseases,
			                    pericardial diseases, and congenital heart diseases&amp;nbsp; and
			                    interventional echocardiography and Doppler. Current active
			                    research projects include outcomes in coronary artery disease
			                    of quantitative and stress echocardiography (SFVAH Heart
			                    and Soul Study&amp;mdash;coPI with Dr. Mary Whooley); contrast

			                    juxtaposition of his basic research background with the clinical
			                    cardiologists in the Division has resulted in an active translational
			                    research program.&amp;nbsp; Dr. Springer's research interests
			                    include cell therapy and gene therapy approaches to studying
			                    cardiovascular disease, with the goals of exploring potential
			                    treatments and understanding underlying mechanisms involved
			                    in angiogenesis, vascular function, and treatments for myocardial
			                    infarction.&amp;nbsp; The laboratory is studying differential
			                    responses of cardiac and skeletal muscle to angiogenic gene
			                    therapy in mice, focusing on effects of VEGF and pleiotrophin
			                    on the vasculature and on the localized protein profile in
			                    the tissue. Further interests center in the therapeutic effects
			                    of bone marrow cell implantation into the heart after myocardial
			                    infarction, using an ultrasound&#45;guided injection approach
			                    that they have developed in collaboration with the Yeghiazarians
			                    lab, with a special emphasis on the therapeutic implications
			                    of the age and cardiac disease status of the cell donor.
			                    Similarly, the lab is studying the effects of age and disease
			                    on circulating endothelial progenitor cells, with a focus
			                    on the roles of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and nitric
			                    oxide in the function of these cells. Lastly, they have developed
			                    a rat model of endothelium&#45;dependent flow&#45;mediated vasodilation,
			                    and are using it to examine mechanisms underlying vascular
			                    reactivity and how they are affected by cigarette smoke exposure
			                    and dietary flavanols. &lt;/P&gt;

			                    combine genetically modified models of cardiac disease with
			                    physiological measurements of cardiac function using cardiac
			                    myocytes, cardiac muscle strips, and intact perfused hearts.&amp;nbsp; Two
			                    related projects are currently underway. 1) Gi Signaling
			                    in Cardiomyopathy.&amp;nbsp; This project tests the hypothesis
			                    that increased signaling by Gi protein&#45;coupled receptors
			                    leads to impaired excitation&#45;contraction coupling.&amp;nbsp; 2)
			                    Alpha&#45;1&#45;adrenergic receptor regulation of myocardial function.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Beta&#45;adrenergic
			                    receptor responses have been well studied, however, alpha&#45;1&#45;adrenergic
			                    receptor responses remain unclear.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Therefore,
			                    the goal of this project is to determine the function of
			                    alpha&#45;1&#45;adrenergic receptors in the heart.&lt;/P&gt;

			                  &lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;karliner&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Dr. Joel S. Karliner&lt;/b&gt; 
			                    is Professor of Medicine. The focus of the Karliner laboratory
			                    is to study mechanisms of cardioprotection during hypoxia/re&#45;oxygenation,
			                    ischemia/reperfusion, and myocardial infarction in normal
			                    and genetically altered mice. Models used are primary cultures
			                    of cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts, an isovolumically beating
			                    mouse heart (Langendorff) preparation, and mitochondria derived
			                    from both types of preparations. They concentrate on the
			                    role of lysolipids, especially sphingosine&#45;l&#45;phosphate (S1P)
			                    and its signaling mechanisms in cardioprotection. Acute studies
			                    involving S1P lyase and long&#45;term studies in a mouse model
			                    of atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction using a synthetic
			                    S1P receptor agonist that can be given orally are underway.
			                    How isozymes of protein kinase C affect cardiac cells has
			                    been a particular area of interest. Another related area
			                    is cardiac remodeling and the molecular regulation of the
			                    gene for matrix metalloproteinase 2 (gel A) in the heart.
			                    Collaborators on these studies are Dr. Gary Cecchini (mitochondria),
			                    Dr. Edward Goetzl (lysophospholipids), Dr. David Lovett (matrix
			                    metalloproteinases), Dr. Anthony Baker (calcium handling),
			                    and Dr. Daria Mochly&#45;Rosen at Stanford (protein kinase C
			                    isozymes), and Dr. Julie Saba at Oakland Children&amp;rsquo;s
			                    Hospital (S1P lyase). An additional area of interest is the
			                    study of vincristine as a cardioprotective agent, with a
			                    focus on preventing doxorubicin toxicity.&lt;/P&gt;

			                    Associate Professor of Medicine in the Division of Cardiology
			                    and Director of Interventional Cardiology and Catheterization
			                    Laboratory Research at San Francisco VA Medical Center. His
			                    primary research interests are in atherosclerotic plaque
			                    imaging and Interventional Cardiology clinical trials. He
			                    is a previous Samuel A. Levine Young Clinical Investigator
			                    (AHA), and developed a novel technique for assessment of
			                    the aorta and its atherosclerotic plaques by Transesophageal
			                    Magnetic Resonance Imaging. A related research goal and interest
			                    is integration, co&#45;registration and co&#45;display of multi&#45;modality
			                    image information for assessing and treating cardiovascular
			                    disease in real time. Dr. Shunk is involved in various multi&#45;center
			                    clinical trials of devices/strategies in the cardiac cath
			                    lab including a multi&#45;center VA study for which he maintains
			                    the core angiography laboratory. &amp;nbsp;He
			                    is also actively involved in the ACC&#45;NCDR Research and Publications
			                    committee and supports projects that take advantage of that
			                    resource.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;

			                    Professor of Medicine. His long&#45;range goal is to develop
			                    new drugs to treat congestive heart failure, ischemic myocardial
			                    injury, and cardiomyopathy. The approach has been to identify
			                    a molecular switch that stimulates adaptive growth of the
			                    heart. This contrasts with the prevailing approach to drug
			                    discovery in heart failure, which seeks to block maladaptive
			                    signaling.&amp;nbsp; The work
			                    has focused on catecholamines and alpha&#45;1&#45;adrenergic receptors,
			                    and new experiments show that these receptors mediate adaptive
			                    signaling in man and mouse.&amp;nbsp; Current projects aim to
			                    translate this new perspective into drug discovery.&amp;nbsp; This
			                    goal requires better understanding of the fundamental biology
			                    of the alpha&#45;1&#45;receptor subtypes, as well as more knowledge
			                    about alpha&#45;1&#45;signaling in human myocytes.&amp;nbsp; The lab
			                    uses a diverse array of techniques in cellular and molecular
			                    biology and physiology. Models include cultured myocytes,
			                    knockout and transgenic mice, and human samples.&lt;/P&gt;

			                    trial of the calcium sensitizer, levosimendan, in acute heart
			                    failure.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;He is active in multiple novel acute
			                    and chronic heart failure development programs, such as the
			                    cardiac myosin activator (CK&#45;1827452), relaxin, adenosine
			                    antagonist (rolofylline), natriuretic peptides, ultrafiltation,
			                    and opiate receptor&#45;like&#45;1 antagonist (ORL&#45;1). In addition,
			                    he is the principal investigator of a two&#45;site study of diuretic
			                    therapy in patients admitted with acute decompensated heart
			                    failure. He serves on Steering and Endpoint committees for

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Dr. Mandar Aras (pronounced MAN&#45;darr ARR&#45;az) was born in Mumbai, India, then moved with his family to Reading, PA when he was a year old. He attended the University of Pittsburgh, earning bachelor’s degrees in neuroscience and economics, a PhD in neurobiology and his medical degree. His dissertation investigated how zinc signaling may help protect neurons from stroke&#45;related damage. Dr. Aras completed his residency at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, NC.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;He was always interested in cardiovascular function and pathophysiology, and especially enjoyed caring for heart failure patients during residency. Dr. Aras came to UCSF for his fellowship because of its unusually strong combination of both clinical training and basic research opportunities. So far, he appreciates the &quot;great mentorship&quot; he has received in his Cardiac Care Unit rotation, and gaining a new skill set from working with the cardiac catherization lab team at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Aras hopes to pursue a career as a physician&#45;scientist focused on heart failure. &quot;Throughout my career, I have opted for multidisciplinary fields,&quot; he said. &quot;With heart failure and transplant cardiology, you develop long&#45;standing relationships with patients, and get to integrate all the subspecialties within cardiology to help patients.&quot; He is also interested in pursuing translational lab research related to heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In August, Dr. Aras married Dr. Mallika Dhawan, a first&#45;year hematology/oncology fellow at UCSF. He enjoys biking and racquetball, and is an avid Pittsburgh Steelers fan.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/ucsfhealthcardiology.ucsf.edu/files/images/baik.png&quot; class=&quot;imgRight&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Dr. Alan Baik grew up in Los Angeles, graduated from Harvard with a bachelor’s degree in biology, then completed his medical degree and internal medicine residency at UCSF. “I found the physiology of the heart and cardiovascular system very interesting, as well as what happened when things went awry,” he said.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;During medical school, Dr. Baik spent two years as a Sarnoff Cardiovascular Research Fellow at the Dana&#45;Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, studying the role of the HIF pathway in remote ischemic preconditioning – a phenomenon in which briefly cutting off the oxygen supply to a distant organ in the body may help protect the heart later during a heart attack. He and his advisor, Dr. William Kaelin, Jr., discovered that deactivating a HIF&#45;regulating gene just in a mouse’s skeletal muscle provided significant cardioprotection during a subsequent heart attack. Dr. Baik and his colleagues found that a metabolite called kynurenic acid helped mediate this protection.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Baik chose UCSF for his cardiology fellowship because of the program’s twin strengths in research and clinical training. So far, he has appreciated the strong focus on teaching, being entrusted with a high level of autonomy to make clinical decisions, and supportive professors who provide help and guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Baik is interested in subspecializing in the care of patients with advanced heart failure, as well as conducting laboratory research to better understand how to prevent and treat this condition. In his spare time, he enjoys running in Golden Gate Park and spending time with friends.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Dr. Gabriel Brooks was born in Washington, DC and grew up in Maryland. He trained to become a concert violinist, but yearned for a career with more human interaction. He had also had an interest in the biological sciences. “I thought that science plus humanities equaled medicine,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p&gt;After receiving his bachelor’s degree in biology from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Dr. Brooks earned his medical degree from Weill Medical College of Cornell University in New York, then completed his residency at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. “Cardiology was a great marriage of treating the whole patient with all of their issues pertaining to the heart, but also having the ability to change their life with things like cardiac catheterization, and things like heart failure drugs and VADs,” said Dr. Brooks, referring to ventricular assist devices that can serve as a bridge to transplant. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;As a Howard Hughes Medical Student Fellow, Dr. Brooks worked in a lab researching the development of coronary arteries, the blood vessels that supply the heart itself with oxygen and nutrients. He is interested in continuing research at UCSF related to heart and coronary artery development, as well as intervention. In his fellowship so far, he has particularly enjoyed working at San Francisco General Hospital, caring for a diverse and underserved patient population. He also appreciated managing care for a patient with complex, rare congenital heart disease, as well as working in the cardiac catheterization lab.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;His wife, Caroline, is French, and Dr. Brooks enjoys speaking and learning more of the language. They are also new parents to a son, Maxime.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;/div&gt;
			
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Dr. Blake Charlton grew up near Stanford University, where both his parents are psychiatrists. He earned his bachelor's degree in English from Yale University, then worked as an English teacher and special education tutor. He is also the author of three novels for young adults and is an advocate for the dyslexic community.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Inspired by his family's example of service, Dr. Charlton earned his medical degree from Stanford, where his mentors included novelist Dr. Abraham Verghese, who is also an expert on the physical exam. &quot;Abraham fascinated me with the exam of the heart and cardiovascular disease; maybe more importantly, he introduced me to the idea of 'the romance of medicine,' which is a concept that continues to inspire me,&quot; said Dr. Charlton. &quot;Cardiology also appealed to me because it's been at the forefront of using evidence to safely develop new treatments.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;He chose UCSF for internal medicine residency and fellowship because of its commitment to public service. During residency, he worked with Dr. Rita Redberg, editor&#45;in&#45;chief of JAMA Internal Medicine, to create the JAMA IM Editorial Fellowship and has written extensively for that journal. Dr. Charlton's research focuses on the risks and benefits of newer blood thinners like Xarelto and Pradaxa. His fellowship highlights so far include caring for patients in the cardiac catheterization lab. &quot;Being able to help someone in mortal danger is incredibly awe&#45;inspiring,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;His future plans include pursuing twin careers in cardiology and writing. &quot;I hope to figure out how to bolt together these two art forms,&quot; said Dr. Charlton. He is currently writing his next novel, this one written for adults and more medically focused. His author website is &lt;a href=&quot;http://blakecharlton.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blakecharlton.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Dr. Pavan Cheruvu (pronounced “PUH&#45;ven CHAIR&#45;ooh&#45;voo”) was born in Michigan and grew up in Tampa, FL. He earned degrees in biomedical engineering, electrical engineering and chemistry from Duke University in Durham, NC. After graduation, he landed a summer internship at Guidant Corporation in Santa Clara, designing cardiac device technology, then earned a master’s in computer science from Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar. “I was so involved in device design that I thought, ‘Wouldn’t it be exciting to understand unmet clinical needs from a physician’s perspective?’” he recalled.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Cheruvu earned his medical degree from Harvard Medical School, where he was enrolled in a joint program with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He took a year’s leave from medical school to work at InfraReDx, Inc., a startup founded by cardiologist Dr. James Muller. As a clinical associate there, Dr. Cheruvu led preclinical studies of a diagnostic catheter that sought to predict heart attacks before they occur. He completed his residency at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, then worked for two years at McKinsey &amp; Company, serving as an engagement manager for medical device and pharmaceutical companies worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;He plans to become an interventional cardiologist, and describes his training in UCSF’s cardiac catheterization lab so far as “phenomenal.” “The quality of care that’s given here and the complexity of the cases have made it a very exciting time for me,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Cheruvu is married to Dr. Deepu Madduri, an oncology fellow at Stanford University. In 2013, they became parents to their daughter, Sofia.

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Dr. Nalini Colaco grew up in Santa Cruz, Calif. She completed her bachelor's degree in biology from the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, her medical degree and a PhD in neurobiology and behavior from Columbia University in New York, and her internal medicine residency from New York Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;She became interested in cardiology because of the many different types of heart disease, as well as the broad range of therapies available to help patients feel better. At UCSF, she is enjoying learning the skills and tools necessary to diagnose and treat heart disease. &quot;It's fascinating to look at different aspects of heart function, and learn how to interpret various studies and tools,&quot; said Dr. Colaco. She also appreciates the camaraderie which is developing among her co&#45;fellows. &quot;We have a really good group, and while we all have different personalities, we complement each other,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
			 
			&lt;p&gt;Her doctoral research was on how connections formed between the brain and spinal cord contribute to development of a functional motor system. Dr. Colaco is now interested in learning more about cardiac development – how congenital heart defects occur, how some may present later in a patient's life, and the long&#45;term effects of surgical repairs. She plans to incorporate both clinical care and research in her career.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Colaco enjoys playing tennis, rooting for the Giants, and spending time with her parents, sister, and nephew, Kaden, 2, and niece, Naya, 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;/div&gt;
			
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;
			
			Dr. Punag Divanji was born in Montreal, Canada, and grew up near Houston, Texas. He earned his bachelor's degree from the University of Texas at Austin in Plan II, an interdisciplinary honors program, then completed his medical degree, internal medicine residency and chief residency from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Cardiology combines his interests in science, people and the opportunity to tackle widespread problems. At UCSF, he has enjoyed working on the advanced heart failure service. &quot;I've seen people who are incredibly sick and require the care of several disciplines as well as new and emerging technologies,&quot; said Dr. Divanji. &quot;I try to be with patients and their families, explaining what's happening to them and asking them to think through the situation with me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;He is interested in specializing in advanced heart failure because of the opportunity to work closely with patients and families, the intellectual challenge of understanding the origin and trajectory of each patient's disease, and the exciting technologies to treat heart failure. These include smaller ventricular assist devices (VADs), as well as innovations such as the CardioMEMS™ HF System, an implantable heart failure monitor which transmits data about how well the heart is pumping to a smartphone or computer. &quot;This is a field where we have the opportunity to create new technology to look at empiric data,&quot; said Dr. Divanji.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Divanji is married to Dr. Diana Divanji, an obstetrician in private practice in Burlingame. Together they enjoy biking, hiking and learning to scuba dive. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;/div&gt;
			
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Dr. Martin Dominguez was born in Pittsburgh and grew up in Indianapolis. He enjoyed science in high school, developing a deep curiosity about how the body works that spurred him to earn a bachelor’s degree in molecular, cellular and developmental biology from Yale, where he also earned a medical degree and a PhD in neurobiology. His doctoral research focused on the development of the cerebral cortex.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;As an internal medicine resident at New York Presbyterian Hospital – Columbia University Medical Center, Dr. Dominguez’s favorite rotations were caring for patients in the critical care unit. He developed a fascination with hemodynamics, the fluid dynamics of blood flow. He decided to come to UCSF for cardiology fellowship in part because of the wealth of research opportunities and mentors at the UCSF Cardiovascular Research Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;So far, he has appreciated the steep learning curve as a fellow. “Every day, I learn something I didn’t know before, and get to use it to help somebody out,” said Dr. Dominguez. “As we get more comfortable, we’re also starting to build trust and the ability to make decisions we feel confident about.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Dominguez looks forward to getting back to laboratory research, and may explore ways to apply his previous investigations of brain development to research about how the heart develops. He hopes to become a physician&#45;scientist, combining a career that includes caring for patients as well as basic research. His outside interests include writing music, exploring new restaurants and spending time outdoors.

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Dr. Srikant Duggirala grew up in Southern California and attended UC San Diego, where he earned his bachelor’s degree in biochemistry and cell biology and a master’s degree in biology. He received his medical degree from Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston, then completed his residency and chief residency at NYU School of Medicine in New York.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p&gt;When he was a teenager, a distant cousin who was training to become a cardiologist stayed with his family for a few months, exposing him to the life of a doctor. Around the same time, one of Dr. Duggirala’s best friends was diagnosed with leukemia, and Dr. Duggirala helped by coordinating bone marrow drives. Those experiences, plus his talent for the sciences, led him to a career in medicine. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;He was drawn to UCSF for the caliber of the fellowship program. “The learning curve is steep, but every day I’m learning something new,” he said. He is interested in pursuing a subspecialty such as electrophysiology, which would allow him to perform procedures and also understand and treat the underlying causes of disease. This dovetails with some of Dr. Duggirala’s previous research experience, in which he analyzed mouse heart cells and also studied animal hearts that had received radiofrequency ablation to fix electrical abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Duggirala greatly enjoys caring for patients. “Just being able to talk with patients, understand what they’re going through and helping to make their lives better is a privilege,” he said. “That’s something I respect, and it means a lot to me.” In his spare time, Dr. Duggirala enjoys photography, kickboxing and watching movies with friends.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;/div&gt;
			
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Born in Moscow, Russia, Dr. Simon Ermakov moved to the Bay Area when he was 7. His mother was a physician, and he also wanted to become a doctor. This interest intensified at age 14 when he was diagnosed with Wolff&#45;Parkinson&#45;White syndrome, a rare arrhythmia, or disorder of the heart’s electrical system.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;After graduating from UC Berkeley with a bachelor’s degree in molecular and cell biology, he decided to undergo cardiac ablation for his arrhythmia, which was becoming more symptomatic. “I was cured of my illness and able to return to an active lifestyle,” said Dr. Ermakov. “The experience was profoundly inspirational, and I knew this was the field to which I wanted to dedicate my life.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;During medical school at UCSF, he conducted research in the lab of Dr. Melvin Scheinman, Walter H. Shorenstein Endowed Chair in Cardiology, who performed the first catheter ablation in humans. Dr. Ermakov helped discover more about arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, a rare cardiac arrhythmia. “Dr. Scheinman is an incredible role model as a researcher, clinician and teacher,” said Dr. Ermakov. During medical residency at Stanford, Dr. Ermakov also conducted clinical research on the relationship between atrial fibrillation – the most common arrhythmia – and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“It’s really stimulating and gratifying to finally dedicate myself fully to this field,” said Dr. Ermakov, who will likely pursue further training in cardiac electrophysiology. He is married to Elaine Ermakova, an account manager. He enjoys skiing, snowboarding and traveling.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Dr. Eugene Fan grew up in San Diego, then earned a bachelor’s degree in molecular biology from Princeton University and a medical degree from UCSF, where he also completed his internal medicine residency. After residency, he worked for a year as hospitalist on the UCSF Advanced Heart Failure Service.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Fan was originally interested in oncology, working in a cancer research lab as an undergraduate and coordinating breast cancer clinical research trials for UCSF breast cancer surgeon Dr. Laura Esserman. As a medical student, he became fascinated by cardiac physiology and the wide range of cardiac diseases. He found a way to bring these two interests together through his recent research with Dr. Atif Qasim, helping to study how echocardiography could detect early changes in cardiac function among cancer patients taking Herceptin. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;So far in his cardiology fellowship, he has especially appreciated caring for critically ill patients in the intensive care unit. “It’s what I came into cardiology to do – putting cardiac physiology into practice to make complex decisions,” said Dr. Fan. “Seeing a very sick patient turn around with our therapies has been very rewarding.” In addition to a passion for patient care, he also enjoys teaching medical students and residents.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Fan is considering further training in advanced heart failure and heart transplantation. His hobbies include playing classical and jazz piano, playing pool and running.

			&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Dr. Christopher Groh spent his childhood near Chicago, then earned a bachelor's degree in biomedical engineering at Duke University in Durham, N.C. and his medical degree from University of Illinois&#45;Chicago before completing his internal medicine residency at McGaw Medical Center of Northwestern University in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;As an undergraduate, he greatly enjoyed a course in cardiac electrophysiology, and became even more interested in the heart during medical school. &quot;With my background as a biomedical engineer, I'm interested in the underlying physiology of the heart, and would like to find new ways to bring basic technology to the bedside,&quot; said Dr. Groh.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;At UCSF, he appreciates the opportunity to rotate at three different hospitals – UCSF Medical Center, San Francisco General Hospital and the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center – and the chance to work with world&#45;renowned faculty. One highlight has been the amount of responsibility entrusted to fellows. &quot;You get a lot of calls in which the patient's future will hinge on what you're asked to do,&quot; said Dr. Groh.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;He will likely pursue further training in cardiac electrophysiology, and plans to combine a career in research and patient care. &quot;It's very satisfying to apply what I've learned to help a patient, and I think they appreciate having a direct conversation about their prognosis and options,&quot; said Dr. Groh.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In his spare time he enjoys waterskiing, and looks forward to sailing on San Francisco Bay and exploring new restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Born and raised near Atlantic City, NJ, Dr. Kelly Guld (pronounced “Goold”) knew in middle school that she wanted to become a doctor – inspired in part by her mother, a labor and delivery nurse.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Guld earned a bachelor’s degree in English literature and creative writing from Dartmouth College in Hanover, NH. She conducted clinical research in hepatitis C, and then attended Boston University School of Medicine, earning a master’s in medical science and a medical degree. She completed her residency at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, where she also served as a hospitalist on the solid oncology service, focusing on palliative care.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Guld “fell in love” with cardiac physiology as an intern, fascinated by how even critically ill patients could often be successfully treated. At UCSF, she appreciates the fast&#45;paced yet supportive environment, and the broad exposure to patients in three different hospital settings. “I feel like I’m turning into a cardiologist,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Guld was attracted to UCSF in part because of its outstanding palliative care program, and hopes to conduct medical ethics research and training around palliative care and end&#45;of&#45;life issues for heart failure patients who have exhausted therapeutic options. “It’s important to understand when it’s time to focus more on quality of life and comfort, rather than very aggressive therapies,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In 2013, Dr. Guld married her wife, Jaclyn Madril, a manager at Whole Foods. Together they enjoy preparing vegetarian feasts, traveling and exploring the Bay Area.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Dr. Philip Hall was born and raised in Cincinnati. While earning a bachelor’s degree in classics at Princeton University, he also took pre&#45;med classes, then earned his medical degree from Yale University and completed his residency and chief residency at Stanford Hospital. His interest in the heart began in high school while shadowing some inspiring cardiologists, and in medical school he found himself drawn to cardiovascular physiology.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;So far in his fellowship, he has had the opportunity to care for patients at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center. &quot;As a resident, I had taken care of many patients who came in with heart attacks, but in my first few weeks as a fellow, I got to teach residents how to take care of patients in that setting, and also participate in the catheterization of that patient – to see the lesion that caused the heart attack and fix it,&quot; said Dr. Hall. &quot;That was really rewarding.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;He has a longstanding interest in teaching, and looks forward to a career in academic medicine where he can share his enthusiasm and knowledge with trainees and patients. &quot;Trying to engage the listener and adapt your teaching to your audience is important,&quot; said Dr. Hall. He has particularly enjoyed caring for patients with advanced heart failure, but also looks forward to the breadth of the fellowship’s rotations, as well as conducting clinical research.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Hall is married to Dr. Leah McNally, a first&#45;year gynecological oncology fellow at UCSF. They enjoy spending time outdoors together and taking trips to Napa, Monterey and Yosemite.&lt;/p&gt;

He studied chemistry and economics at Dartmouth College in Hanover, NH, then received his medical degree from Duke University in Durham, NC and completed his residency at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. He was drawn to the problem&#45;solving aspect of medicine involved with understanding disease processes, as well as the opportunity to work with people.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p&gt;He became particularly interested in cardiology because he liked the balance of caring for critically ill patients, as well as following patients with chronic diseases over the long haul. “I also liked that cardiology offers an opportunity to apply a mathematical, physics&#45;based approach to problems,” said Dr. Hayward. “In cardiology, we get to think a lot about the pressures and electrical system of the heart, applying a quantitative approach every day.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;He came to UCSF for his fellowship because it has an “amazing” training program, with exposure to patients from many backgrounds and outstanding faculty. He was also attracted to the wide range of research opportunities, as well as the chance to live in San Francisco. At this point, he is particularly interested in pursuing electrophysiology as a subspecialty, and in conducting clinical research related to that area.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Hayward grew up fly fishing the rivers of Maine, and is excited to test Northern California’s waters.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Dr. Bettina Heidecker was born in Austria and grew up in the town of Gmunden. She earned her medical degree from Innsbruck Medical University, and began a postdoctoral fellowship in cardiovascular research at the Johns Hopkins University, working with Dr. Joshua Hare. When he was recruited to the University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, she followed him to continue her research and to complete residency in internal medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Her research investigated the role of gene expression in heart failure, identifying a cluster of genes that was very predictive for how well or poorly patients with newly diagnosed heart failure were likely to do in the future. She and her colleagues also worked to improve diagnosis in heart failure, discovering a molecular signature that was highly predictive of myocarditis – inflammation of the heart muscle usually caused by an infection.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“I got fascinated by cardiology when I started my research in that field,” said Dr. Heidecker. “I was especially impressed by all the compensatory mechanisms that are activated in the setting of heart failure.” She chose UCSF for her fellowship because of the combination of rigorous clinical training and extensive research opportunities. “The faculty take time to sit down with you and discuss cases, and lectures are tailored to the questions we encounter when we treat patients,” said Dr. Heidecker. She is especially interested in heart failure and plans to continue her research in that field.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Heidecker enjoys running, hiking and windsurfing, and looks forward to skiing this winter.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Dr. Gregory Judson grew up in Connecticut and earned his bachelor’s degree in molecular biology and biochemistry from Middlebury College in Middlebury, Vt. He conducted prostate cancer research at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, earned his medical degree from Columbia University in New York, then completed internal medicine residency and chief residency at UCSF.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The cardiologists he met seemed like consummate physicians. “Cardiologists care for patients whenever and wherever they need help, whether they’re in the clinic, the cath lab or the ICU,” said Dr. Judson. He decided to remain at UCSF for his cardiology fellowship partly for the breadth of experience he would gain by caring for patients at three hospitals: Moffitt&#45;Long Hospital on the Parnassus campus, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital (ZSFG), and San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center. “UCSF also was one of the few cardiology training programs in the country that combines clinical and research excellence,” he said.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;So far, Dr. Judson has enjoyed the collegial atmosphere, taking care of very sick patients at ZSFG, and the opportunity to share what he knows. “The best teachers have a deep understanding of the subject, and can teach it to all different types of learners,” he said. “As a fellow, it’s been really rewarding to be learning every day and get the chance to teach medical students, interns and residents.”
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Judson lives in San Francisco with his wife and daughter, and enjoys hiking, skiing and mountain biking.

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Dr. Shadi Kalantarian knew she wanted to become a cardiologist at age 13, when her mother needed a pacemaker – which at that time was difficult to obtain in their home country of Iran.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;She earned her medical degree from Shahid Beheshti University School of Medicine in Tehran, then earned her master’s degree in public health from the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston. She served as an electrophysiology research fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston before completing her internal medicine residency at Yale University School of Medicine in New Haven, Conn.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In her research, she has investigated links between atrial fibrillation – the most common abnormal heart rhythm – and cognitive impairment. There may be factors, such as high inflammatory markers, which predispose patients to develop both atrial fibrillation and dementia. However, another hypothesis is that small blood clots originating in the heart travel to the brain, causing “silent” strokes. “If we find that atrial fibrillation contributes to dementia, maybe we should think about giving blood thinners to lower&#45;risk patients to help prevent dementia,” said Dr. Kalantarian. “There are still so many questions that need to be answered.”
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Thus far in her cardiology fellowship, Dr. Kalantarian has appreciated the collegial and welcoming atmosphere. “We have a wonderful group of fellows, and I have the most amazing preceptor,” she said. Dr. Kalantarian has enjoyed all her fellowship rotations so far, but has a particular interest in electrophysiology. Aside from medicine, she enjoys hiking, biking, and playing the Hang, a steel drum.

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Dr. Ahmed Kheiwa is an advanced Adult Congenital Heart Disease Fellow at the University of California San Francisco. He joined the ACHD program at UCSF in July 2016 for a two&#45;years training.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kheiwa completed his medical school at the University of Mansoura Medical School, Egypt, followed by a one&#45;year internship at Mansoura University Hospitals. In 2009, he moved to the United States to join the internal medicine&#45;pediatrics residency program at Wayne State University. His interest in the pathophysiology and hemodynamics of congenital heart diseases was further pursued by completing a three&#45;years pediatric cardiology fellowship at Children's Hospital of Michigan. In 2016, he was board certified in pediatric cardiology by the American Board of Pediatrics.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kheiwa then decided to witness the adult perspective of congenital heart diseases and was fascinated by their hemodynamic complexity. He planned to further specialize in Adult Congenital Heart Disease by completing a formal training in the field.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“UCSF has one of the top, most prestigious adult congenital heart disease programs in the country,” Dr. Kheiwa says, adding that he values the excellent training, fascinating patient population and chance to work with mentors such as Dr. Ian Harris, director of the Adult Congenital Heart Disease Program at UCSF Medical Center. When finished, Dr. Kheiwa hopes to practice in an academic setting where he can continue his clinical and research interest.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;His life outside the hospital is almost as busy as that inside, as he is married and the father of two boys with whom he loves to travel about the city and play multiple sports.

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Dr. Payal Kohli (pronounced “PILE CO&#45;lee”) was born in Chandigarh, India, and moved to the U.S. at age 9. She earned dual bachelor’s degrees in molecular biology and brain and cognitive science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and her medical degree from Harvard Medical School. She received residency training in internal medicine from the Brigham and Women’s Hospital as well as anesthesia and critical care for a year at Massachusetts General Hospital. Due to her love for science, she pursued a research fellowship after residency, working with the prestigious TIMI Study group, under the leadership of Dr. Eugene Braunwald, to do cardiovascular clinical research.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;She came to UCSF for her fellowship because of its reputation for having the most rigorous clinical training program in the country. “You see the inner city patient population at San Francisco General, the elderly male population at the VA Hospital, and a little bit of everything that is complicated at Moffitt,” said Dr. Kohli. “There are also a lot of strong female role models who are very prominent in cardiology.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;So far, Dr. Kohli has especially enjoyed her imaging rotation. She is interested in combining additional training in this area with her background in clinical trial research, using tools such as MRIs and echocardiograms to measure the impact of new drugs and therapies on the heart.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In her spare time, she enjoys exploring beautiful San Francisco and visiting the Napa Valley.

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;
			Dr. Jane Lee was born in Seoul, South Korea, growing up there and in a suburb of Atlanta, Ga. She earned her bachelor's degree in biomedical and electrical engineering from Duke University in Durham, N.C. She enjoyed thinking about problems in terms of systems and equations, but ultimately chose a career in medicine so she could apply those skills more directly to patients. She completed her medical degree from Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, and her internal medicine residency at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lee found her engineering background especially well&#45;suited to cardiology. &quot;The heart is the pump, and the blood vessels are like channels,&quot; she said. &quot;I like thinking about the variables that change the way blood flows through our body.&quot; She came to UCSF for her fellowship in part because the third year allows trainees to pursue research full&#45;time, and hopes to conduct outcomes research on heart failure patients who receive ventricular assist devices (VADs).
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;She has also appreciated navigating clinical situations with a high level of autonomy. &quot;It's very gratifying when I can conceptually think through a problem and solve it,&quot; said Dr. Lee.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;She is currently interested in specializing in heart failure and transplant cardiology. &quot;Heart failure is really the endgame for any heart disease, and you also get to see the entire spectrum of disease,&quot; said Dr. Lee.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;She is an avid runner, commutes by bicycle to all three hospitals, and enjoys longer bike rides outside San Francisco.

She majored in neurobiology at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY, and earned her medical degree from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, where she also completed her residency. She has worked as a research assistant in a number of laboratories, studying topics ranging from the molecular mechanisms of cancer to simulated prosthetic vision to preventive cardiology. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Narla was attracted by medicine’s intellectual challenges, the opportunity to do service work, and the ability to conduct research, teach and practice in a wide range of areas. She was especially drawn to cardiology in medical school. “There is so much fascinating pathophysiology in cardiology,” she said. “Also, within cardiology, there is such a broad range of exciting subspecialties – electrophysiology, imaging, interventional cardiology, and many more.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;She chose UCSF for her fellowship because of its “phenomenal” cardiology training program, as well as the opportunity to live in San Francisco. “Already, I have learned so much, even more than I expected,” said Dr. Narla. “The faculty are great teachers, and are very supportive and enthusiastic.” She looks forward to the various rotations during her fellowship to help her decide which area within cardiology she would like to focus on, but knows she is interested in conducting clinical research. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In her free time, Dr. Narla enjoys exploring San Francisco and painting watercolor landscapes and portraits.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Dr. Babak Nazer was born in Iran, and moved to the U.S. at age 5, where he grew up in Seattle. He majored in biomedical engineering and psychology at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, where he became fascinated by the heart. “The physiology of the heart is so interesting, with the interplay of electric, mechanical and fluid dynamics systems – three completely different types of engineering coming in to play in one organ,” said Dr. Nazer. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p&gt;Although he considered becoming a bioengineer, he said he “fell in love” with the patient interaction side of medicine while an undergraduate volunteer at Johns Hopkins Children’s Center, a pediatric hospital. He earned his medical degree at Harvard Medical School, and completed his residency at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Nazer chose UCSF for his cardiology fellowship in part because it would allow him excellent opportunities to pursue broad clinical training as well as research. He is excited by his current rotation in the ultrasound lab. “I’m blown away by how much physiology is contained in an echocardiogram,” he said. Dr. Nazer plans to pursue a career in academic medicine, and might subspecialize in either imaging or interventional cardiology. He is also looking forward to conducting research during his third fellowship year, and is excited by the many potential mentors at UCSF. “Everyone here has been so welcoming and helpful, and has helped show me the ropes,” he said. “I’m really excited to be part of the UCSF family.” Dr. Nazer  is the 2012&#45;2013 Cardiology Chief Fellow.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In his spare time, Dr. Nazer enjoys long&#45;distance road biking, playing basketball, cooking and eating.&lt;/p&gt;

He earned his bachelor's degree in biochemistry from Ithaca College in Ithaca, N.Y., then worked in a genetics lab at New York University. He initially planned to investigate novel cancer therapies via the use of small interfering RNA technology, and enrolled at New York Medical College in Valhalla, N.Y. to better understand the natural history and treatment of cancer.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p&gt;A few months into medical school, he became so fascinated with the physiology and physics of the heart that he decided to pursue cardiology instead of oncology. After finishing his medical degree, he completed his internal medicine residency at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York. He chose UCSF for his fellowship because of its combined excellence in clinical training and research. &quot;The teaching environment here is incredible,&quot; said Dr. Papolos. &quot;It's clear that the faculty is thoroughly invested in the education of the fellows.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;He hopes to become a cardiac intensivist and eventually to direct a cardiac critical care unit at an academic medical center, helping critically ill patients and those with advanced heart failure. &quot;It's amazing to see someone come in when they are in extremis,&quot; said Dr. Papolos. &quot;You don't know which way it's going to go, and together you get through it – and you watch them walk out the door. I don't think there's much that I've experienced in medicine that's more rewarding than that.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In his free time, Dr. Papolos enjoys cooking, nature and traveling.

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Dr. Mitchell Psotka (pronounced “SOTT&#45;ka”) was born and raised in Rockville, MD. He first became interested in medicine while helping to care for his grandmother through a long illness. He earned a bachelor’s degree in biology from Brown University in Providence, RI, then attended the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, VA, where he earned a master’s degree in biological and physical sciences, a PhD in microbiology and a medical degree. His doctoral research focused on hemolytic uremic syndrome, a disorder caused by &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; infection that can result in microvascular kidney injury.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Psotka did his residency training at UCSF, and was drawn to cardiology because of the opportunities to be involved in all aspects of a patient’s care. “You can see someone in clinic, perform the echocardiogram, make the diagnosis and perform the cardiac catheterization,” he said. “In addition to the diverse experience, it allows you to expedite care if you need to.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;So far, he has been excited to learn each new cardiology procedure, and has appreciated the opportunity to care for some of the sickest hospitalized patients as the overnight cardiology consultant. He is interested in focusing on heart failure, and hopes to work with UCSF cardiologists Dr. Liviu Klein and Dr. John Teerlink on research related to Sudden Cardiac Death in women and minorities, and developing ways to prevent death and rehospitalizations among heart failure patients.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Psotka met his wife, Caroline, a high school English teacher, through playing Ultimate Frisbee, a sport they still enjoy. They are proud parents of a newborn daughter, Clara.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;/div&gt;
			
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Born and raised near Philadelphia, Dr. David Rosenthal was inspired by his father, a cardiologist, and decided to pursue cardiology himself. He earned a bachelor’s degree from Boston University, a medical degree from New York University School of Medicine, and completed internal medicine residency at the University of Washington Affiliated Hospitals in Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;As a resident, Dr. Rosenthal worked with mentors on research related to cardiac sarcoidosis, a rare autoimmune disorder which is often difficult to diagnose and treat. Sarcoidosis usually causes scarring of the lungs, but when the disorder affects the heart, it can cause abnormal heart rhythms and different forms of heart failure. “If it’s recognized early, this condition can be treatable,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Highlights of his fellowship experience so far have been the collegial spirit among his co&#45;fellows, as well as the breadth of patients he has been able to see. “At Moffitt, we get the opportunity to see all kinds of interesting diseases and resulting cardiac diseases that I don’t think you commonly see elsewhere,” said Dr. Rosenthal. “One thing that is very satisfying about cardiology is that we can often help people feel better in a short period of time.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rosenthal hopes to pursue a career in cardiac electrophysiology – the diagnosis and treatment of abnormal heart rhythms – and also plans to continue his research in cardiac sarcoidosis. In his spare time, he enjoys hiking, baseball and running. He is engaged to Molly Anderson, MD, an internal medicine resident currently living in Seattle.

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Dr. Aarthi Sabanayagam was born in New York City, and at age 6 moved to Chennai, India. Her medical school training was at Chennai’s Sri Ramachandra Medical College and Research Institute. After an internship there, she was awarded externships in Internal Medicine and Cardiology at Beth Israel Deaconess and Brigham and Women’s Hospital at Harvard.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;She moved back to her birthplace in 2005 for a three&#45;year residency at the Montefiore Medical Center–Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, followed by four years as a direct&#45;care hospitalist at Montefiore, and three years as a fellow in cardiovascular medicine. “I’ve been training all my adult life,” Dr. Sabanayagam says with a laugh. Her interest in Adult Congenital Heart Disease (ACHD) was piqued during her fellowship under Dr. Ali Zaidi—an adult and pediatric cardiologist at Montefiore.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The UCSF ACHD fellowship intrigued her with its focus on research and high quality clinical care, as well as mentorship provided by Drs. Elyse Foster, Vaikom Mahadevan and Ian Harris. Dr. Sabanayagam feels privileged to work in a program that housed some of the “giants in Pediatric Cardiology,” and with patients operated on in the 1970s and 1980s who are still thriving today.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;As Dr. Sabanayagam pursues her specialty in ACHD and echocardiography, she describes the field as the “the center of the Venn diagram of all of my favorite circles—young people, complex anatomy and hemodynamics, pregnancy, imaging, and heart failure—all the areas that I’m fascinated with.”
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Following adult patients with childhood cardiac anomalies as well as patients discovered later in life to have a congenital defect is fascinating in its variety. “Every patient is different,” says Dr. Sabanayagam, who loves the idea that she’s able to help young people lead a better quality of life. “It’s really rewarding and satisfying work.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In her free time Dr. Sabanayagam explores San Francisco and Napa Valley, especially the vibrant food scene, and heads out to the water whenever she has a chance.

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Dr. José Sanchez was born in Ecuador, spent part of his childhood in Mexico City, where his father trained in cardiology, then eventually settled with his family in Las Vegas, NV. He earned his bachelor’s degree in chemistry from Washington University in St. Louis, MO, and his medical degree from Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, OH. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;During medical school, he spent a year at UCSF as a Sarnoff Cardiovascular Research Foundation Fellow working in the lab of Dr. Robin Shaw. Dr. Sanchez studied Connexin43 (Cx43), a protein critical to the conduction of the electrical signals within the heart which allow the heart to beat. He discovered which molecular processes in Cx43 are disrupted during a heart attack – often contributing to problems including abnormal heart rhythms and even sudden cardiac death.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;He returned to UCSF for residency, continuing his research in Dr. Shaw’s lab, and decided to stay at UCSF for his fellowship. So far, Dr. Sanchez has been particularly excited to perform angiograms to determine which artery in a patient’s heart is blocked. &quot;I’ve wanted to do cardiology since before high school, and it was amazing to finally be the person who was holding the catheter and injecting the contrast [dye], and being part of the team that was doing an immediate, lifesaving intervention,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sanchez is especially interested in electrophysiology, a subspecialty focused on abnormal heart rhythms. Earlier this year he married Dr. Maggie Brooke, a third&#45;year general surgery resident based at UCSF&#45;East Bay. Dr. Sanchez’s hobbies include biking and drumming to hard rock.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Born in India, Dr. Abhishek Singh grew up in Scotland, Arizona and New Jersey. He majored in chemistry and biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, MA. Dr. Singh then received his medical degree from the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in Piscataway, NJ, where he also earned his PhD in biochemistry and molecular biology. For his doctorate, he researched protein folding, specifically tropomyosin and its role in the regulation of muscle contraction. Dr. Singh completed his residency at UCSF.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p&gt;As a lifelong athlete, he always understood the importance of cardiovascular health, a background which contributed to his interest in cardiology. “From the moment you are born to the moment you pass away, your heart continuously pumps blood,” he said. “Any dysfunction and it can have severe complications.” He also was drawn to the mathematical, logical aspect of cardiology.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Singh is particularly interested in doing research and providing care for patients with advanced heart failure. “There are a lot of opportunities for research there, and there is a lot we don’t understand,” he said. “We don’t understand the mechanisms for reversing disease, which is something that interests me, including developing novel therapeutics to help regain function – whether it is regenerative, or augmenting cardiac function with medications. It’s a great field.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In his spare time, Dr. Singh enjoys playing soccer and basketball, and eating spicy food.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Dr. Krishan Soni (pronounced “KRIH&#45;shan SO&#45;knee”) was born and raised on Long Island. Many of his family members suffered from heart disease, sparking an interest in medicine. He earned bachelor’s degrees in biochemistry and economics at Yale University, where he also obtained his medical degree and a master’s in business administration. Dr. Soni then completed his residency at UCSF, where he also served as chief resident for quality improvement and patient safety.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;He became interested in cardiology because of his family’s health history as well as the physics and biology of the heart. The field also dovetailed with his interest in health care systems and management. “Cardiac disease is a major burden in the U.S. and the world, and there are many things we can do to deliver better patient care and create a more efficient and cost&#45;saving system,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;So far his fellowship rotations have included the cardiac catheterization lab and the heart failure and transplant service. “We see really sick patients that most hospitals don’t have the resources to care for,” said Dr. Soni. “We’re very lucky to see that specialty medicine, and to work with knowledgeable faculty who are amazing teachers.” He plans to pursue a career that includes both clinical care as well as work on a broader level, such as helping to shape national health policy or improving systems of health care delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Soni is married to Ahn Jiwajinda, a health care quality improvement analyst. Together they enjoy traveling internationally.

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Dr. Jana Svetlichnaya was born in St. Petersburg, Russia, and moved to Chicago when she was 11 years old. She earned a bachelor’s degree in biology from the University of Chicago, becoming intrigued by how the heart forms during fetal development. She earned a master’s degree from the London School of Economics and Political Science, where she studied comparative costs of health care in different countries. She then earned her medical degree from Northwestern University in Chicago, and completed her residency at McGaw Medical Center of Northwestern University. While at Northwestern, one of her research mentors was Dr. Liviu Klein, who is now on the UCSF faculty.  She chose UCSF for her fellowship in part to continue working with him.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p&gt;So far, she has appreciated caring for heart failure patients at Moffitt. “The pulmonary hypertension and congenital heart disease populations at UCSF are so interesting and rich,” she said. “Their complexity presents a great challenge, both in terms of managing them clinically, but also in terms of research.” She has also been inspired by working with advanced heart failure specialist Dr. Teresa De Marco. “She cares so deeply about her patients and invests so much of herself into their care,” said Dr. Svetlichnaya. “I have come to view her as a role model.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Svetlichnaya plans to pursue advanced fellowship training in heart failure, as well as clinical research focusing on cost&#45;effectiveness and health outcomes in heart failure. In her spare time, she enjoys running, hiking and bicycling, and is excited to explore the great outdoors of Northern California.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Dr. R. Croft Thomas, Jr. was born in Atlanta, and grew up there, as well as Charlotte, NC, Stockholm, Sweden, and Houston. He earned a bachelor’s degree in business administration from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, then worked as a technology analyst before deciding to become a doctor. “I was excited to work directly with people who had a need, rather than on the commercial interests I saw in the business world,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p&gt;He attended George Washington School of Medicine in Washington, DC, then transferred to Emory University in Atlanta, where he earned his medical degree. Dr. Thomas completed his residency at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Although most cardiology fellows complete their clinical training before embarking on the research years of their fellowship, Dr. Thomas decided to do his research training first – an option that UCSF offers to its cardiology fellows. He worked with UCSF cardiologist and researcher Dr. Paul C. Simpson, helping develop a new human heart model to study potential cardiac medications. With support from the California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences (QB3), the group co&#45;founded a company, AdrenaRx, to patent a small molecule compound to treat heart failure that was identified by Dr. Simpson. “I wanted to go where the best research was taking place in medicine, and UCSF was certainly at the top – it was a great opportunity,” said Dr. Thomas.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;As much as he enjoys research, Dr. Thomas loves seeing patients, and is happy to be starting his clinical cardiology training. Dr. Thomas is married to Dr. Hilary Thomas, a UCSF endocrinology fellow. Together they have two young daughters, Elsa and Coles.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Dr. Jeremy Tietjens hails from St. Louis, Mo., where he earned his bachelor’s degree in philosophy, neuroscience and psychology from Washington University. While working in a pediatric neuroscience laboratory at UCLA, he enjoyed the interactions with research participants so much that he decided to become a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tietjens earned a medical degree from Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, then completed internal medicine residency at UCSF, where he worked with cardiologist Dr. Rakesh Mishra on developing ways to use echocardiography – ultrasound of the heart – to estimate the relationship between pressure and volume in the heart. They used this information to identify patients at increased risk for heart failure or heart attack. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;After residency, he spent a year working on the UCSF heart transplant and heart failure service. “When things went well, it was amazing how we could restore someone who was unable to do any physical activity to a decent quality of life,” said Dr. Tietjens. He plans to specialize in this area of cardiology.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tietjens began his cardiology fellowship at Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center, caring for a high volume of very sick patients. “It was trial by fire, and I got to do a lot of life&#45;saving procedures for the first time,” he said. “I had a lot of help, but it made me feel like a cardiologist.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tietjens is married to Dr. Gillian Heinecke, a dermatology resident at Stanford University. In his free time, he enjoys surfing, hiking and visiting wine clubs in the Napa Valley.

He graduated from Brown University with a bachelor’s in neuroscience, then earned his master of public health and medical degrees from Johns Hopkins, where he also completed his residency. He became interested in cardiology because of the public health implications of cardiovascular disease. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tison has done considerable clinical research in metabolic risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and has participated in public health projects in Singapore, South Africa and Thailand. Most recently, he volunteered in the China&#45;California Heart Watch program. He traveled to small villages in Yunnan Province, screening schoolchildren for congenital cardiovascular diseases that can result in death by age 20 if left untreated. “Once these conditions were fixed, these kids could potentially have close to a normal life span and quality of life,” said Dr. Tison. “The impact was very measurable, and it was a great experience for me.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tison plans to pursue a career in academic medicine, with a focus on clinical and epidemiological investigations that impact public health and global health. “In the next few years, I’m looking forward to gaining more clinical cardiology exposure, and will be out on the hunt for other interesting [research] questions,” he said. He is also interested in bringing a creative approach to medicine, applying innovative ideas to both research and health care delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Dr. Rohan Wagle (pronounced “ROW&#45;han WOGG&#45;lay”) was born and raised in the Houston area. He earned his bachelor’s degree in biochemistry from Rice University and his medical degree from Baylor College of Medicine, both in Houston. He then completed his residency at The Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, and spent another year researching the molecular biology of a rare heart disease called Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia under Dr. Daniel Judge.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;His interest in the heart began in high school, when he was matched with a career development mentor, Dr. John Passmore, who was a cardiologist with the University of Texas&#45;Houston. For his fellowship, he wanted a program that was strong in both research and clinical training. “Many programs are good in one or the other, but UCSF is good at both,” said Dr. Wagle.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Already, he has experienced the satisfaction of making a difference in patients’ lives. “I’ve had patients who have come into the ER with heart attacks, feeling like their lives are going to end, and being able to help them so they can walk out of the hospital on their own two feet is very gratifying,” said Dr. Wagle. “It’s rewarding to be part of a career where the diseases are fatal if untreated, but if you get to it in time, there’s so much we can do.” He is interested in specializing in heart failure or inherited heart diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;To relax, Dr. Wagle plays basketball and the violin, and tries out new restaurants with his wife, Rita Wagle, a nurse.

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Dr. Isaac (Ziggy) Whitman was born in Philadelphia, where he spent most of his childhood. He admired his father, Dr. Glenn Whitman, a cardiac surgeon now at Johns Hopkins. “I grew up with the idea that the heart was at the center of medicine – isn’t it?” said the younger Dr. Whitman about his decision to become a cardiologist.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;After earning a bachelor’s degree in psychology from Harvard and his medical degree from Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, he completed his residency at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;So far, his fellowship experience has been challenging, exciting and varied. “I continue to find the privilege of being in medicine surreal, especially when called upon at 2 a.m.!” he said. “It’s a great system – while we are given a lot of responsibility right up front, we each have a backup second&#45;year fellow the first month who becomes our mentor for the rest of the year. We benefit from the learning of making decisions, without the burden of making them alone.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;He spent the first month at San Francisco General Hospital. “That was a great experience,” said Dr. Whitman. “I saw more heart block in one month than I’d seen during all of residency.” His interest in EKGs, plus his enjoyment of performing procedures which can correct a problem, is leading him towards a career in electrophysiology.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Whitman is married to Sanja Whitman. Together they have two young children, Natalija and Yannick.

After graduating from Stanford University with a bachelor’s degree in mathematical and computational science, she worked as a data analyst at Kaiser Permanente, then earned her medical degree from Weill Cornell Medical College and completed her residency at Columbia University Medical Center, both in New York.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;As a Sarnoff Cardiovascular Research Foundation Fellow, she worked with Dr. Harlan Krumholz and Dr. Sarwat Chaudhry at Yale School of Medicine. Among other projects, Dr. Wong studied changes in the heart failure population in recent decades. Thanks to improved treatments, many patients survive heart attacks but eventually develop heart failure – along with other diseases that increase their medical complexity. &quot;Sometimes we are either too aggressive or not aggressive enough in managing these patients, and I am interested in optimizing their care to improve mortality as well as quality of life,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;She chose UCSF for fellowship in part because of the excellent reputation of both the Cardiology and Geriatrics faculty, and plans to continue her research on older patients with cardiovascular disease. Highlights of her fellowship so far include getting to use her Cantonese with patients at San Francisco General Hospital, and caring for a variety of severely ill patients. &quot;It’s very rewarding to treat patients who are really sick and need your help,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Wong is married to Matthew Beasley, a former Navy submarine officer who now works for Intel. They enjoy hiking and camping, and welcomed their first child, Margaret, this fall.

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Dr. Joseph Yang was born in Providence, RI and grew up in Ann Arbor, MI, where his father was a pharmacy professor. Dr. Yang earned his bachelor’s degree in biochemistry and molecular biology from Brown University, and then spent three years at Tokyo Women’s Medical University pursuing stem cell research in the lab of Dr. Teruo Okano. Among other projects, Dr. Yang worked on cell sheet engineering, in which extremely thin sheets of stem cells could be grown and layered – in a process a bit like papier&#45;mâché – to reconstruct heart tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;He earned his medical degree from Wayne State University School of Medicine in Detroit, then completed his residency at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. He chose UCSF for his fellowship because of its combination of excellence in clinical training and research. &quot;There are so many legends in the field of cardiology at UCSF, and getting to work next to them is amazing,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Yang hopes to combine a career in clinical medicine and research, and is particularly interested in translational research for tissue engineering. &quot;I would love to be a person that brings a lab discovery to patients,&quot; he said. As a clinician, he especially enjoys caring for critical care patients in the CCU.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;He and his wife, Yukie Asahina, are proud parents of Misa, 4, and Kenzo, who was born five days after his fellowship began.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Dr. Lucas Zier, born and raised in San Francisco, was inspired to pursue medicine in part by accompanying his father, a geriatrician, on hospital rounds. He earned a bachelor’s degree in history from Cornell University in Ithaca, NY, then enrolled in the UC Berkeley&#45;UCSF Joint Medical Program, earning a master’s degree in health and medical sciences and a medical degree. After completing his residency at UCSF, he then spent a year working as an attending hospitalist on the advanced heart failure service at UCSF.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p&gt;He chose cardiology after becoming fascinated by the heart’s physiology, and by witnessing the challenges of a childhood friend with congenital heart disease. He is interested in discovering the best ways to manage patients with congenital heart disease and heart failure. “There is really not a lot of research in this area, because quite frankly, patients just haven’t lived that long,” said Dr. Zier. “Now we’re starting to have patients live into their 40s and 50s with congenital heart disease who are starting to develop heart failure. I often find myself in situations where there is no evidence, so it’s so important to do research to answer those questions.” Among his mentors at UCSF, he includes Dr. Elyse Foster, Dr. Teresa De Marco and Dr. Liviu Klein.
			
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Zier plans to specialize in the clinical care and research of such patients. He is married to Katie Zier, a senior manager at McKesson. They enjoy dining and traveling, and are planning a trip to climb Mount Kilimanjaro.&lt;/p&gt;

Faculty Spotlight: Dr. Michelle A. Albert ./cardiology/facstaff/spotlight/albert.html
		</Fname>
		<Tax>1736</Tax>
		<Path>./cardiology/facstaff/spotlight/albert.html</Path>
		<FileBody>
			
			&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/ucsfhealthcardiology.ucsf.edu/files/images/albert.jpg&quot; class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Photo credit: Elizabeth Fall&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Dr. Michelle A. Albert, who recently joined the Division of Cardiology faculty, was raised in Guyana, South America by her grandparents while her parents studied in England. She planned to become an actuary like her father, but everything changed when her grandfather died suddenly in his early 60's. His death, her intense experiences of growing up in a third world nation, her in&#45;depth study of the history of slavery, and her love of science inspired her to become a physician&#45;researcher.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
			When she was 15, her family moved to Brooklyn. She studied chemistry at Haverford College in Pennsylvania, graduating at age 20, then attended the University of Rochester School of Medicine. She completed internal medicine residency and chief residency at Columbia University, followed by research and clinical fellowships at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, where she served on faculty for a decade, eventually becoming an Associate Professor. She also earned a master's degree in Public Health from the Harvard School of Public Health. Under the tutelage of Dr. Paul M. Ridker, Dr. Albert researched inflammatory biomarkers of cardiovascular risk prediction, with an emphasis on minorities and women. She has translated her work into cardiovascular health promotion, mentoring, and risk prevention for racial and ethnic minorities and women at the community, national and international levels. Dr. Albert has received several awards for her research and advocacy efforts. 
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
			
			Dr. Albert now transitions to UCSF Cardiology after serving as Chief of the Division of Cardiovascular Medicine at Howard University in Washington, DC. She joined the UCSF faculty in January.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;h4&gt;&lt;u&gt;Investigating Brain&#45;Heart Connection&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
			
			Her own experiences fostered an interest in how social factors such as racial discrimination or job stress can have adverse biological effects. &quot;Some forms of adversity differentially experienced by some racial and ethnic groups are akin to post&#45;traumatic stress disorder,&quot; said Dr. Albert. &quot;Psychological stress is a normal part of life, but chronic, persistent stress that is accompanied by a lack of control has a negative impact on health.&quot; Among other problems, chronic stress is associated with hypertension, obesity, inflammation and continual activation of the &quot;fight or flight&quot; response.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
			
			Yet very little research is available about the interplay of adversity and biology: how does chronic stress affect biological indicators of disease, progression of atherosclerosis, heart failure and other conditions? In addition to discovering more about these questions, Dr. Albert is investigating how social support and childhood learning opportunities cultivate resilience and the ability to adhere to healthy habits later in life.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
			
			&quot;Brain patterning and neurocognitive function is essentially formulated by age 12,&quot; said Dr. Albert. &quot;Early involvement in activities like music and sports helps young people access different parts of their brain and develop skills for lifelong learning that are also important for practicing self&#45;care. Without such opportunities, it's less likely that at age 35 or 65 they will have the ‘biological fitness' to follow through on recommendations such as exercising or taking a daily statin.&quot; 
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
			
			Dr. Albert has established the UCSF CeNter for the StUdy of AdveRsiTy and CardiovascUlaR DiseasE (NURTURE), which examines the biological and social interconnectivity of adversity across the lifespan, from pre&#45;pregnancy into adulthood. The multidisciplinary center investigates the physiological underpinnings of adversity – for example, how stress affects the brain, and how these changes in turn may affect the heart – and develops interventions to prevent and treat disease. The center also trains and mentors researchers interested in how adversity impacts cardiovascular health.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
			
			&quot;A lot of UCSF faculty are pioneers in stress research, and it's a very fertile environment,&quot; said Dr. Albert. &quot;I'm excited to collaborate with investigators who lead the field in their domains.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
			
			In addition to directing NUTURE, Dr. Albert sees general cardiology patients in clinic and cares for hospitalized CCU patients. &quot;Taking care of patients, you meet people at their most vulnerable,&quot; she said. &quot;They entrust a lot in you, and it's a privilege to be able to touch someone's soul.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
			
			In her free time, Dr. Albert enjoys spending time by the water, traveling with her husband, Edward, listening and dancing to Beyonc&amp;eacute;'s music as well as afternoon tea. 
			
			&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot; style=&quot;padding:0;&quot;&gt;
			As an undergraduate at Yale, Dr. Atif Qasim (pronounced “AH&#45;tiff KAH&#45;simm”) was debating between a career in medicine or teaching. “After talking with a lot of folks, I realized I could actually do both in academic medicine,” said Dr. Qasim, who joined the Division of Cardiology faculty in 2012.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
			His passion for teaching inspired him to write the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Medicine/PrimaryCare/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195388046&quot;&gt;Hitchhiker’s Guide to Internal Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, published by Oxford University Press in 2010, a practical overview for medical students and interns as they begin providing patient care. He also co&#45;founded a medical education company called Cardio QnA, whose goal is to provide aspiring cardiologists a cost&#45;effective way to prepare for board exams.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Qasim also built his own &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.echocardiographer.org&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, which combines videos of echocardiograms – ultrasound imaging of the heart – with helpful information for performing and interpreting these diagnostic tests. “Imaging is a very visual modality,” he said. “Seeing a picture is worth a thousand words. When I’m talking with a resident or cardiology fellow, I can just pull this website up on any computer and show them an echocardiogram of the classical form of a condition…. People have e&#45;mailed us about this website from across the country and even from places like Germany and Turkey saying, ‘It’s great!’”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Building on his lifelong interest in art and drawing, Dr. Qasim even creates his own medical illustrations.

			&lt;h3&gt;Using Imaging for Prevention&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Qasim earned his medical degree from Johns Hopkins University, then completed his residency, chief residency and cardiology fellowship at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, where he also earned a master’s in clinical epidemiology and biostatistics. At UCSF, in addition to seeing patients at the Mission Bay clinic, performing and reading echocardiograms, and caring for hospitalized patients, he pursues research in using cardiac imaging to prevent heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;For example, imaging tools such as echocardiography, cardiac CT scans or MRI can provide information about how weak the heart is, which parts of the heart have been affected, and what treatments are most likely to help them. “The goal of imaging is to be as minimally invasive as possible, while getting information we need without harming patients,” said Dr. Qasim.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Qasim also uses imaging to evaluate patients in clinical trials to determine the efficacy of new devices and procedures. “Part of our goal is to identify the patients that are going to benefit most from a particular procedure,” he said. He is also interested in using imaging to determine which patients are most likely to develop heart failure from specific cancer drugs, which could help shape their cancer treatment and prevent irreparable damage. Similarly, imaging might be used to detect early signs of rejection in heart transplant patients, reducing the need to take repeated biopsies that could actually harm the transplanted heart.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;There are many other questions that still need more research. “Some people come in with a weak heart, and after doing all the tests, you still don’t know exactly why that patient developed heart disease, or who else in their family might be at risk,” said Dr. Qasim. He is excited to work with the new UCSF Health eHeart Study, which includes a large database and biospecimens from a growing number of patient volunteers. By collecting and analyzing huge amounts of biological and genetic information, as well as imaging studies and details about lifestyle habits, researchers expect to discover more about what causes heart disease, and which treatments are most effective for particular types of patients. “Imaging techniques can help to risk&#45;stratify folks, and decide how aggressive you need to be with treatment,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Qasim is married to Dr. Saeher Muzaffar, a pulmonary and critical care doctor at Sequoia Hospital in Redwood City. Together they have two young children.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot; style=&quot;padding:0;&quot;&gt;
			As an undergraduate at Yale, Dr. Atif Qasim (pronounced “AH&#45;tiff KAH&#45;simm”) was debating between a career in medicine or teaching. “After talking with a lot of folks, I realized I could actually do both in academic medicine,” said Dr. Qasim, who joined the Division of Cardiology faculty in 2012.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
			His passion for teaching inspired him to write the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Medicine/PrimaryCare/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195388046&quot;&gt;Hitchhiker’s Guide to Internal Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, published by Oxford University Press in 2010, a practical overview for medical students and interns as they begin providing patient care. He also co&#45;founded a medical education company called Cardio QnA, whose goal is to provide aspiring cardiologists a cost&#45;effective way to prepare for board exams.

			&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin&#45;left:10px;&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/ucsfhealthcardiology.ucsf.edu/files/images/aranout.png&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; style=&quot;max&#45;width:100%;&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Photo credit Elisabeth Fall.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Dr. Rima Arnaout's fascination with heart development started in college, when she was studying eye formation in chicks.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;We pecked little holes in the eggs to watch the chick embryos, and you just couldn't miss that the heart was pumping even before developing into a recognizable organ,&quot; said Dr. Arnaout. &quot;It struck me how vital heart structure and function are to life, even before birth. Yet how could something so important also be most commonly affected by birth defects? It was a conundrum I wanted to learn more about.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;After graduating with a bachelor's degree in biology and minor in bioengineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, earning her medical degree from Harvard Medical School and completing her internal medicine residency at Massachusetts General Hospital, Dr. Arnaout came to UCSF for her cardiology fellowship. She recently joined the UCSF faculty. In addition to studying heart development in zebrafish, she is now leveraging advances in gene sequencing and Big Data to better understand &quot;genotype&#45;phenotype correlations&quot; in cardiovascular disease – teasing out which gene mutations are associated with observable traits, such as birth defects of the heart.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;The most simple genotype&#45;phenotype correlations are when one gene causes a very obvious, highly heritable phenotype,&quot; said Dr. Arnaout. &quot;Mendel was studying that back in the day with his peas. But many diseases aren't caused by just one 'smoking gun' gene – it could be a combination of genes or the dose of that gene. The more genes that are involved, the more complicated it is.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;As a physician&#45;scientist, Dr. Arnaout is also interested in more accurately phenotyping disease – 
			for example, identifying which subtype of heart valve disease a patient has. She likens it to sorting a basket filled with different varieties of apples. &quot;If you mix in Red Delicious with Granny Smith and McIntosh and look for [significant] genes, you're not necessarily going to find them because the phenotype hasn't been well defined,&quot; she said. &quot;Anyone in clinical practice knows that accurately phenotyping a patient is always a challenge – you initially think they have one diagnosis, and it turns out it's another.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Arnaout wants help discover ways to mine vast amounts of clinical data – including imaging studies, blood tests, and studies of the heart's electrical properties – to discover underlying patterns among patients with the same condition. &quot;It's thinking of ways to use clinical data beyond helping us care for an individual patient – if we analyze it all together, it's data that can teach us something,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Among other investigations, Dr. Arnaout is involved with a sub&#45;study of the Health eHeart Study, which has enrolled 30,000 participants worldwide who contribute genetic samples as well as data via wearable sensors and mobile apps. About 2 percent of Health eHeart Study participants have congenital heart disease – caused by birth defects of the heart. Adult congenital heart disease is a relatively new field, since surgical advances in recent decades now allow most babies born with heart defects to live into adulthood. There are dozens of different kinds of congenital heart disease, making it challenging to gather adequate research data about this population. &quot;Health eHeart is a way to start capturing enough numbers of participants so we can learn new things about the genetics of heart disease, as well as study new treatments that will lead to better care,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In addition to her research, Dr. Arnaout spends most of her clinical time in the echocardiography lab, interpreting ultrasounds of the heart. A self&#45;described &quot;science nerd,&quot; she derives great satisfaction from teaching others, whether trainees or patients. &quot;It's great to see residents get excited and really understand something,&quot; she said. &quot;With patients, I enjoy explaining what their problem is, why they have it, what symptoms to look for, and what will make it better.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;When she's not in the hospital or the lab, Dr. Arnaout enjoys exploring San Francisco with friends, playing tennis, rock climbing and salsa dancing.&lt;/p&gt;

Faculty Spotlight: Dr. Kirstin Aschbacher ./cardiology/facstaff/spotlight/aschbacher.html

			&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/ucsfhealthcardiology.ucsf.edu/files/images/aschbacher.jpg&quot; class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Behavior Change Meets Data Science&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kirstin Aschbacher works at the intersection of clinical psychology and data science, combining digital tools and insights into what makes us tick to promote positive behavioral change.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Born in Pasadena, Calif., Dr. Aschbacher grew up playing piano and guitar, and learned the basics of computer programming from her father, a mathematician. She graduated from Brown University with a bachelor’s degree in music composition and theory, and studied piano performance at the New England Conservatory of Music.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A tragic event altered her life course: when she was 20 years old, her younger sister died in a car accident. “I was introduced to what clinical psychologists could offer people, and I realized that there is this a whole psychological toolbox that can help you through life,” said Dr. Aschbacher. “In our culture, mental health is very stigmatized. Often, people only learn about this toolbox if they have a severe mental health problem or life event, but these are fundamental life skills that should be more like learning to write a check or how to maintain your car.”&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The desire to make that toolbox more widely accessible fueled her professional focus on health psychology and lifestyle change. Dr. Aschbacher earned her doctoral degree in clinical psychology from a joint program of UCSF and San Diego State University, then completed a yearlong internship in behavioral medicine and psychology at the University of Washington Medical Center and Harborview Medical Center in Seattle. She then came to UCSF, completing a psychology and medicine postdoctoral fellowship, as well as another fellowship in complex systems analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;From the beginning of her psychology training, she was interested in mind&#45;body science, and in San Diego she worked with a research group investigating the effects of chronic stress on cardiovascular disease. At UCSF, she built new collaborations and skills, using engineering and mathematical modeling to learn more about stress biology.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Aschbacher was recruited to the UCSF Department of Psychiatry faculty in 2012, and received a K23 career development award from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to pursue her burgeoning interest in the overlap between data science and behavioral medicine. “I believe that the new frontier of behavior science involves digital technology, because you can get data at such a larger scale and speed from wearable devices, and even test out lifestyle interventions,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;h4&gt;&lt;u&gt;Tackling Big Challenges with Big Data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;While she had taught herself a number of computer programming languages during graduate school and beyond, she decided to take her skills to the next level by attending the &lt;a href=&quot;http://insightdatascience.com/&quot;&gt;Insight Data Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; in Palo Alto, a seven&#45;week data science boot camp. “You had to have a PhD to even apply, and half the group were astrophysicists,” said Dr. Aschbacher. “I was the only psychologist there. It was an intimidating group, but I got through the program and learned a lot.”&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the fellowship she met many industry leaders, and was recruited as a data scientist in the behavior change team at &lt;a href=&quot;https://jawbone.com/&quot;&gt;Jawbone&lt;/a&gt;, which manufactures the UP fitness tracker. A significant percent of UP users were actively trying to lose weight. To help these users reach their weight loss goals, Dr. Aschbacher and her colleagues tested the efficacy of various notification strategies – such as which messages users found most useful for helping them exercise more or eat less.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;They also applied psychological insights to hone these messages. For example, they tried to help users self&#45;regulate what they eat, sending empathetic messages normalizing the temptation to eat delicious but unhealthy foods and providing basic behavioral skills training. They also encouraged users to log their food intake to counteract the natural instinct to lapse at times when willpower is worn down, such as snacking late at night.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The team also developed adaptive interventions – personalizing messages based on how much a person exercised or what they ate since the previous message. For example, if the app recommended a step goal of 10,000 and a specific user fell far short of meeting that number, they tried to set a more realistic target as the next goal. “Ideally, the goal you recommend should be based on a user’s history of behavior and maybe also what they’ve done that day so far,” said Dr. Aschbacher.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Their experiments usually included between 10,000 and 100,000 participants, numbers that many academics can only dream of. “One of the biggest learnings I got out of being in industry was how scale really changes everything,” said Dr. Aschbacher. She contrasts that to her clinical training, where she might co&#45;lead a small group at a place like the VA. “It’s a nice model, but it’s not very scalable in terms of being able to reach millions of people in all kinds of locations and deliver a cost&#45;effective service,” she said. “And it may be that some self&#45;regulation strategies are best learned out in the world, where people are experiencing the stressors and temptations of daily life… You want to practice applying your new skills in the moment you really need them. With digital technology, you might be able to have a ‘coach’ you can turn to when the experience is really fresh in your mind.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h4&gt;&lt;u&gt;Best of Both Worlds&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Aschbacher was recruited back to UCSF in 2017 by Dr. Jeffrey Olgin, chief of the Division of Cardiology and one of the principal investigators of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.health&#45;eheartstudy.org/&quot;&gt;Health eHeart Study&lt;/a&gt;, a novel investigation that uses smartphones, wearable devices and apps to gather big data from participants worldwide, in order to ultimately predict, understand and treat heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;She is particularly interested in developing interventions to improve health using machine learning – a field of computer science in which computers can learn from finding patterns in vast amounts of data without being explicitly programmed. It’s the technology that helps fuel speech recognition, self&#45;driving cars and many other innovations. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt; “Machine learning doesn’t seem to be as widespread in academia as it is in industry, but it has a lot of power and potential,” said Dr. Aschbacher. “On the other hand, one thing scientists do particularly well is to gather data in a way that is really rigorous and uses strong research designs. My dream is to combine the best of both worlds to advance lifestyle medicine.” &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt; “Kirstin brings a unique combination of skills into the Division, including a background in psychology, industry&#45;sharpened user experience and design, as well as proficiency in data analysis and machine learning,” said UCSF cardiologist &lt;a href=&quot;https://cardiology.ucsf.edu/facstaff/spotlight/tison.html&quot;&gt;Dr. Geoff Tison&lt;/a&gt;, who also leverages big data to promote cardiovascular health. “Her combination of skills is synergistic with and will be valuable for a range of research and programmatic initiatives in the Division.” &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Many of Dr. Aschbacher’s research interests focus around preventive cardiology, such as using digital tools to help patients eat better, exercise more and reduce chronic stress. She has already begun to collaborate with researchers within the Division of Cardiology in areas such as how to best control high blood pressure among pregnant women, and how to support positive behavioral change among patients of the UCSF Center for Prevention of Heart and Vascular Disease. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Aschbacher commonly works with interdisciplinary teams of physicians, immunologists, microbiologists and neuroscientists, and has forged long&#45;term collaborations with Dr. Elissa Epel and Dr. Ashley Mason in the UCSF Department of Psychiatry.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt; “Kirstin is an expert in the intersection of lifestyle and behavioral risk factors – including stress, diet and self&#45;regulation – for cardiovascular disease and obesity, and focuses on digital health and big data methodologies,” said Dr. Mason. “She is an outstanding collaborator with whom I have had the good fortune to work for several years, and key collaborator of the &lt;a href=&quot; http://beelab.ucsf.edu/&quot;&gt;UCSF BEE (Biology and Experience of Eating) Lab&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;h4&gt;&lt;u&gt;Eating and Obesity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Translating good advice into practice is easier said than done. “A lot of interventions, especially in the digital wellness space, tend to invest heavily in what we call ‘psychoeducation,’” said Dr. Aschbacher. “For example, they may tell users, ‘These are the kinds of foods you should eat.’ But even with knowledge, many of us find it hard to stick with our intentions. A lot of my recent research focuses on how we measure and improve our ability to ‘self&#45;regulate’ or control our behavior. When does self&#45;regulation fail us, and why? Knowing this, how can we design an intervention differently?”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;For example, self&#45;regulation plays a key role in eating and obesity. In order to better understand what drives reward&#45;based eating and cravings, Dr. Aschbacher and Dr. Mason are conducting a unique and integrative study. They are assessing how cravings are linked with the way that consuming sugar influences participants’ cognitive function and metabolism. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;For example, participants took a cognitive test when they were fasting, and then again an hour after drinking a sugary beverage. It turns out that drinking a high&#45;sugar beverage appears to affect obese and lean individuals differently in terms of their tendency to focus on food cues and to eat more sweets, even after a full meal. “We’re trying to connect the dots between what the patient is experiencing, what they are eating, and any underlying differences in the neurocircuitry or brain metabolism, so we can help people learn to self&#45;regulate more effectively,” said Dr. Aschbacher. “People don’t want to just count their calories, they want help managing temptation and sticking with their intentions.” &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h4&gt;&lt;u&gt;Make it a Habit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Yet another area that intrigues Dr. Aschbacher is helping people make the leap from goals to habits. For example, many exercise apps are very goal&#45;oriented. “You have a step goal for today, and another step goal tomorrow,” she said. “But the thing about goals is that they’re effortful – you have to make a conscious effort to hit them, and over time they lose their reward value. The first time you hit your goal, you feel good and the app congratulates you, but once you’ve gotten the same message for two weeks, it stops having that rewarding effect.” &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest challenges to behavior change is getting new behavior to stick. “That’s why habit formation is so important,” said Dr. Aschbacher. “The next era of apps has to focus less on goals and more on habits. A healthy habit should be intrinsically rewarding and fit into your lifestyle without always having to think about it.” &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Aschbacher has cultivated her own exercise habit, which includes a morning walk, Zumba and spin classes, running, biking to work and hiking. She also takes an oil painting class once a week and is studying Mandarin. She is married to Grean Chiranakhon, a software engineering manager, and together they have a young son, Tarin. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Her ultimate goal is to build a self&#45;regulation app that takes a different approach to wellness. “I want to change the dialogue, so it’s less about reaching goals and counting calories,” said Dr. Aschbacher. “Let’s figure out how to make the process of choosing healthy habits feel just a little bit easier and more natural. Although there are many wellness apps on the market, it is important to show, through research, that your wellness app actually impacts health. My goal in combining behavior change science with machine learning is to create change that sticks.” &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/ucsfhealthcardiology.ucsf.edu/files/images/dr_beatty.jpg&quot; class=&quot;imgLeft&quot; style=&quot;margin&#45;top:10px;&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;“We do a very good job of giving patients medications, but we’re less successful at encouraging people to exercise, eat well and monitor their weight,” said Dr. Alexis Beatty, a preventive cardiologist who recently joined the faculty.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Behavioral changes are easy to recommend, but often harder for patients to implement. One helpful tool is cardiac rehabilitation, which combines exercise training with education about nutrition, weight management and other topics. “Cardiac rehabilitation can help people live longer and feel better, and it doesn’t cost as much as many other interventions,” said Dr. Beatty.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Yet only a fraction of people with heart disease actually enrolls in such programs. To help more patients, Dr. Beatty is developing a mobile phone application in collaboration with Dr. Yoshimi Fukuoka, a School of Nursing researcher with mobile app experience, Dr. Judith Moskowitz, a social psychologist and epidemiologist, and Dr. Mary Whooley, an internist.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The app will track patients’ physical activity, weight, blood pressure and heart rate, and will teach them how to self&#45;manage their heart disease. After participants enter their goals for physical activity, the app can send a congratulatory message if participants meet their target, and send exercise reminders if participants fall short.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			
			&lt;p&gt;“Rather than just a monthly visit to a provider, we will have the opportunity to support behavior change in response to real&#45;world cues,” said Dr. Beatty. The app builds on behavior change theory by starting small, setting goals, and providing feedback on participants’ progress.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Because some evidence suggests that promoting positive emotions improves patients’ long&#45;term adherence to exercise, the team is developing a component to amplify positive events. This could include focusing on gratitude and noticing when things go well. “Even if you are going through a stressful time with your illness, you don’t have to ignore the good things in your life,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
			 
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Beatty has also been involved with the Heart and Soul Study, led by Dr. Whooley, which studies a group of patients with stable coronary artery disease. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Strategies for Better Health&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Beatty majored in biomedical engineering at Duke University, where she also earned her medical degree. She became interested in prevention during a medical school rotation in obesity, working at diet centers with patients who were trying to lose weight. She completed her residency at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, and her fellowships in cardiology and preventive cardiology at UCSF.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Beatty served as chief cardiology fellow from 2010&#45;2011, helping organize educational activities and grand rounds for the Division of Cardiology. Among other honors, she has received the Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, and the Elizabeth Barrett&#45;Connor Research Award in Epidemiology from the American Heart Association.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In addition to her research, Dr. Beatty sees patients about a quarter of her time. She enjoys helping them develop heart&#45;healthy strategies, such as eating more fruits and vegetables. “It’s been found that people are less successful when they’re trying not to do things, like eat fat,” she said. “It’s easier for people to eat five fruits and vegetables a day.” Yet this change often reduces the amount of fat consumed, because patients already feel full.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
			To help patients increase physical activity, she suggests parking their car 15 minutes away from work, which builds in a walk at the start and end of each day. Dr. Beatty’s own exercise goal is to work out at the gym four mornings a week. She also wears a Fitbit, averaging about 8,000 steps a day.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p&gt;She is enthusiastic to be working in such a collaborative environment, and looks forward to establishing her cardiology practice. “There’s a great group of patients who come to UCSF, and it’s really exciting to listen to their stories, help them find solutions to their problems, and hopefully see them get better over time,” said Dr. Beatty.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p&gt;She is married to Dr. Jes Alexander, a senior radiation oncology resident at UCSF. Together they have enjoyed traveling to New Zealand, India and the Galapagos Islands.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;&quot;My philosophy of medical education is that trainees are colleagues with less experience,&quot; said Dr. Michael Crawford, director of the UCSF Cardiology Fellowship Program since 2007 and the Lucie Stern Chair in Cardiology. &quot;I don't believe in the old European style of ‘Herr Professor,' where you go around telling people what to do. You have to have this dialogue with fellows, and teach in a way that respects their opinion. It's a give&#45;and&#45;take.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Crawford was born in Madison, Wis., and grew up in Redwood City, Calif. In high school he got a job at Sequoia Hospital to support his car habit – at that time, a 1949 Chevy. He worked as a pathology assistant, filing specimens and helping with autopsies. &quot;I thought, ‘I don't get queasy doing this, so maybe I could be a doctor,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;After graduating from UC Berkeley, he earned his medical degree and completed the first two years of internal medicine residency at UCSF. &quot;One of the reasons I went into cardiology was having great mentors at UCSF who could examine a patient and pretty much come up with what was wrong with them at the bedside, without having to do a lot of tests,&quot; said Dr. Crawford. &quot;There are certain specialties, like cardiology, where you can do that. Also, there were a lot of new developments, and cardiovascular disease was a big killer, so it was a field where you could make a difference.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;He completed his residency training at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston, Mass, where the chairman of medicine invited him to develop a lecture series for students at Harvard Medical School. &quot;I just loved the process of simplifying complex things, boiling it down to what a third&#45;year medical student really needed to know, as well as the interaction with the students,&quot; said Dr. Crawford. &quot;They asked great questions that made you think.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;He completed his cardiology fellowship at UC San Diego, where he later served on the faculty. He remembers a young patient with unexplained shortness of breath. &quot;My mentor there, Dr. Robert O'Rourke, listened to her heart and said, ‘Oh, she has pulmonic stenosis'&quot; – a heart valve deformity which can obstruct blood flow. &quot;This was a subtle finding, and her previous echocardiogram hadn't nailed down the anatomy of that particular valve,&quot; said Dr. Crawford. A more focused echocardiogram confirmed the diagnosis, and the team treated the faulty valve with a balloon&#45;mounted catheter, curing her and allowing her to resume playing volleyball. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;That aligned with my philosophy of getting as much information as possible at the bedside, and using selective tests that are targeted and focused,&quot; said Dr. Crawford. &quot;I've seen cardiologists who order 10 tests on a patient, but I don't like to practice that way – it's impersonal, and an expensive shortcut to spending time with the patient.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;He later served on the faculty at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio, Texas, the University of New Mexico School of Medicine in Albuquerque, N.M., and Mayo Medical School in Rochester, Minn., before joining the UCSF faculty in 2003. Among his many research contributions, Dr. Crawford helped develop standards for stress echocardiograms, which are used to evaluate the heart during exercise or pharmacological stress. He also conducted early research on using Doppler echo to determine the severity of aortic valve stenosis, which had previously been evaluated through invasive cardiac catheterization.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;He is proud of the trainees he has mentored during 20 years as a training director at UCSF and other institutions. &quot;These programs have turned out some really good doctors who have become leaders in the field and are advancing research frontiers,&quot; said Dr. Crawford.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;His hobbies include swimming, skiing, biking, and British automobiles. His current automotive &quot;patient&quot; is a 1960 MGA, which he has driven since medical school and used to court his wife, Janis Crawford, a retired entrepreneur who most recently worked as a meeting planner. Together they have three grown children and six grandchildren.

		<FileBody>
			
			&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/ucsfhealthcardiology.ucsf.edu/files/images/delling.jpg&quot; class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Photo credit: Elisabeth Fall&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Dr. Francesca Delling’s fascination with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) began during echocardiography fellowship at Massachusetts General Hospital. For her research project, she collected blood samples and echocardiograms – ultrasounds of the heart – from 43 relatives of a man with MVP.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
			“I flew to Ohio, Virginia and New York with my backpack and ultrasound, scanning extended family members in their homes,” said Dr. Delling, who grew up in Italy.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
			The mitral valve separates the left atrium and ventricle, and has two leaflets that open and shut like French doors. MVP affects about three percent of the population and often runs in families. It occurs when the leaflets fail to form a tight seal, allowing blood to flow backwards. It’s caused by a genetic abnormality that prompts the leaflets to keep growing like they do in utero, rather than stopping at birth. “It’s not typically a disease of children, and usually manifests in the 40s or 50s,” said Dr. Delling.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;By studying the blood samples and echocardiograms that she collected from her travels, Dr. Delling and her colleagues identified genes associated with MVP. More recently, she collaborated with the Leducq MITRAL Transatlantic Network, using genome&#45;wide association studies to pinpoint additional genes linked to the disease.
			&lt;/P&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Although she completed medical school and cardiology training in Italy, Dr. Delling decided to pursue her career in the United States. She completed her internal medicine residency at Boston University Medical Center and cardiovascular medicine fellowship at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, and earned her master of public health degree from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. She joined the UCSF faculty in 2016.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h4&gt;&lt;u&gt;Early Warning Signs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
			Dr. Delling also works with the Framingham Heart Study, established in 1948 to identify heart disease risk factors. Participants return every few years for follow&#45;up. She measured the geometry and length of mitral valve leaflets in past echocardiograms of participants who later developed MVP, and discovered that many had a precursor or “prodromal” version of the condition. “There were characteristics that were very similar to prolapse, but not quite,” she said. “Ninety percent of people with the prodromal morphology went on to develop prolapse.”
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
			This is significant, because it might allow for earlier intervention. Currently, the only treatment for advanced disease is valve repair or replacement. Dr. Delling hopes a drug could eventually be developed that could slow abnormal leaflet growth.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
			Her current research focuses on MVP patients who develop abnormal heart rhythms called arrhythmias. “It’s a rare event, but some of these people die suddenly, and nobody really understands why,” said Dr. Delling. Unlike the chunky scar tissue that heart attack survivors develop, some MVP patients develop a lacy filigree of scar tissue in between heart cells. She hopes to learn what causes this scarring, and how to prevent resulting arrhythmias.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
			“Francesca brings tremendous value to the Division, applying rigorous clinical research methods honed by formal training and experience,” said Dr. Gregory M. Marcus, Endowed Professor in Atrial Fibrillation Research. “Her focus on valve disease is particularly relevant, and, given the many important unknowns that persist, ripe for fruitful investigation.”
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
			“UCSF was extremely fortunate to recruit Dr. Delling,” said echocardiographer Dr. Elyse Foster. “Her investigations on the genetic basis of mitral valve prolapse have enhanced our understanding of this relatively common disease. With her broad knowledge of cardiovascular epidemiology, genetics and cardiovascular imaging, she brings a unique combination of skills to the Division of Cardiology.”
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
			In addition to her research, Dr. Delling reads echocardiograms, cares for hospitalized patients, and has a weekly clinic focused on MVP. She is married to Dr. Markus Delling, who recently joined the UCSF physiology faculty. They enjoy exploring Northern California with their children, Giulia and Elio.

		<FileBody>
			&lt;img src=&quot;http://profiles.ucsf.edu/profile/Modules/CustomViewPersonGeneralInfo/PhotoHandler.ashx?person=4766875&amp;ShowSilhouetteAsDefault=True&quot; class=&quot;imgLeft&quot; style=&quot;margin&#45;top:10px;&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;More than 5 million people in the United States have heart failure, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Heart failure occurs when the heart cannot pump enough blood and oxygen to support other organs. Common symptoms include shortness of breath during daily activities, having trouble breathing when lying down, swelling in the legs, ankles or lower back, and general fatigue and weakness.
			
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Heart failure can often be controlled through a combination of medications, reducing salt in the diet, and exercise. However, some patients continue to deteriorate despite optimal medical and electrical device therapy and progress to advanced heart failure. “These are patients who are on all the right medications, but can’t walk a block or up a flight of stairs without feeling short of breath or fatigued,” said Dr. Teresa De Marco, medical director of heart transplantation and the director of the heart failure and pulmonary hypertension programs. “Their quality of life is poor, and they have a shortened survival.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. De Marco encourages physicians to refer patients with heart failure as early as possible, when the progression of the condition may be slowed by medication and lifestyle changes. Even if a patient has advanced heart failure, prompt diagnosis and treatment can improve outcomes. “By seeing patients earlier, we may be able to improve quality of life, and help patients avoid developing additional complications such as kidney failure,” said Dr. De Marco. “If patients do need advanced therapies, earlier referral can help these therapies be more successful.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. De Marco works closely with Dr. Dana McGlothlin and Dr. Robin Shaw, who are also heart failure specialists, as well as Dr. Charles Hoopes, director of the heart and lung transplant program at UCSF Medical Center. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“We have a really strong team, and we develop an individualized care plan for each patient,” said Dr. De Marco. “We offer the full spectrum of state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art therapies for patients with heart failure, from oral medication therapies all the way to mechanical support and heart transplant.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Ventricular Assist Devices&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;About 20 percent of patients referred to the Heart Failure Clinic are diagnosed with advanced heart failure, and may be candidates for advanced therapies. These include ventricular assist devices (VADs) and heart transplant.&lt;/p&gt;
			 
			&lt;p&gt;UCSF Medical Center implants 15 to 20 VADs annually. These devices, also known as mechanical circulatory support, supplement or replace the flow of blood generated by the heart. The ventricles are the lower chambers of the heart; a VAD can be implanted to support just the left ventricle, which pumps oxygen&#45;rich blood to the body, or the right ventricle, which pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs. Some VADs can be used to support both the left and right ventricles at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In 2008, the Food and Drug Administration approved the Thoratec HeartMate II, a newer type of VAD which is compact enough to fit in the palm of the hand. It is ideal for smaller body types, such as short women who might have difficulty accepting some of the older types of VADs, which are much larger and use bulky pumps. The HeartMate II uses a rotor inside a tube which provides a continuous flow of blood. This device is currently used at UCSF as a “bridge to transplant,” allowing seriously ill patients to improve their strength and health while waiting for a donor heart to become available. This allows patients to go into surgery in the best condition possible, improving their chances of good short&#45; and long&#45;term outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“There is a whole explosion in the technology of this field,” said Dr. De Marco. “With these new, smaller devices with fewer complications, there is no reason to wait until the last possible moment to implant them. These devices reduce the risk of surgery. They are easier to insert and are less prone to malfunction than the older VADs.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. De Marco anticipates that UCSF will be approved to implant the HeartMate II as “destination therapy” sometime early next year. This means it could be used to improve quality and length of life for patients who are not good candidates for heart transplant, such as those who are older or have other conditions that would negatively impact the outcome of heart transplantation. Patients can live with VADs for several years; many who were hospitalized and near death can return home and resume daily activities. Because VADs help the heart pump oxygenated blood to the rest of the body, patients feel more energetic and healthy than they have for months or years.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Critical patients may need other interventions to stabilize them before receiving a VAD or transplant, such as extracorporeal life support (ECLS). ECLS is similar to a heart&#45;lung machine, and can be used for days to pump and oxygenate a patient’s blood. This allows the heart and lungs to rest, and buys time while the medical team determines optimum therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Patients might also receive an intra&#45;aortic balloon pump or an Impella. These devices are inserted through a puncture or cut in the femoral artery, at the groin, and are threaded through the arteries up to the heart. The intra&#45;aortic balloon pump sits in the aorta, the body’s main artery. It deflates when the left ventricle contracts, creating a vacuum that helps to propel the blood forward and unloading the left ventricle, and inflates when the left ventricle relaxes (fills), helping to perfuse the coronary arteries.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p&gt;The Impella is maneuvered between the aortic valve and the left ventricle. Left ventricular blood fills the catheter within which is located a rotor that propels blood into the aorta. This increases blood flow from the left ventricle to the rest of the body, reducing the amount of work the heart needs to do and increasing the amount of oxygen the body receives.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Two new investigational mechanical circulatory devices are currently under study in the United States. The HeartWare Left Ventricular Assist System is a small, implantable centrifugal blood pump. Also, the SynCardia Total Artificial Heart replaces the pumping function of both the right and left ventricles. “This area of development is very exciting, providing more potential options to patients with advanced heart failure,” said Dr. De Marco.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Heart Transplantation&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;UCSF also has an outstanding heart transplantation program, performing about 20 heart transplants a year – more than 250 since the program’s inception. “We have excellent outcomes, despite caring for some of the sickest patients,” said Dr. De Marco.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;One&#45;year patient survival rates for heart transplant are 95 percent, and three&#45;year survival rates are 87 percent, which are among the best in the Bay Area. Dr. De Marco attributes this to several factors. “We are highly experienced in the management of patients,” she said. “We have an inpatient service which includes hospitalists, heart failure fellows, experienced heart failure attendings, and close surgical collaboration. We also have an incredible team of nurses, coordinators, pharmacists, dieticians and social workers, as well as excellent cardiac anesthesiologists and perfusionists.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“Also, the same team of doctors follows patients all the way through, from the pre&#45;transplant evaluation, during hospitalization for transplant, and after they are discharged for post&#45;transplant care. That allows us to provide superlative continuity of care.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The waiting time for a donor heart ranges from weeks to a few months for the sickest patients, and months to years for other patients. Under national regulations, hearts must go to the sickest patients first in a given geographic area. Many factors contribute to the actual wait time, including medical urgency, the recipient’s blood type and body size, and the length of time the recipient has been actively on the waiting list.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Once an appropriate donor heart becomes available, patients go immediately to UCSF, where they are prepped for the transplant surgery. Patients are put on a heart&#45;lung bypass machine and ventilator. Surgeons make a major incision down the chest, remove most of the old heart, and transplant the new heart.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The transplant team cares for the patient before and after surgery. The new heart is supported with intravenous medications during the first three to five postoperative days to assure protection of all vital organs.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The team also provides long&#45;term follow&#45;up, monitoring heart function and immunosuppression medications needed to prevent rejection of the donor heart, as well as medications to prevent infection and treat high blood pressure. UCSF is currently participating in clinical trials sponsored by the National Institutes of Health to observe and prevent long&#45;term development of accelerated cardiac allograft vasculopathy of transplanted hearts – disease of the coronary blood vessels – that limits long&#45;term survival after heart transplantation.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;UCSF is also a leader in offering dual&#45;organ transplants. Significant kidney disease has traditionally disqualified patients from receiving a heart transplant, because diseased kidneys can lower the chances that a heart transplant will be successful in the long run. Yet heart failure often contributes to kidney dysfunction due to inadequate blood supply to the organs.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;UCSF heart and kidney transplant specialists work closely to help patients in need of both a new heart and kidney successfully receive a dual transplant. “One of the distinguishing features of our program is that we create opportunities for transplantation, rather than limiting them,” said Dr. De Marco. So far, UCSF has performed 20 heart&#45;kidney transplants, with heart and kidney transplant surgeons working side by side in the operating room. One&#45;year patient survival rates are comparable to patients who receive a heart transplant alone. UCSF has also performed 10 heart&#45;lung transplants.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Whether a patient receives one organ or two, Dr. De Marco and the rest of the transplant team are committed to caring for that individual for life. “Once patients come under our care and eventually undergo a heart transplant, we are in it for the long term,” she said. “They become like part of our family, and we are rooting for them every step of the way.”&lt;/p&gt;

		<FileBody>
			&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/ucsfhealthcardiology.ucsf.edu/files/images/deo2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;imgLeft&quot; style=&quot;margin&#45;top:10px;&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Dr. Rahul Deo, who joined the Division of Cardiology faculty in spring 2011, wants to find  better ways to predict an individual patient’s chances of developing disease, and which treatments are most likely to be effective.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;He compares this challenge to trying to predict the weather – for example, the way meteorologists measure humidity and temperature, analyze historical weather patterns, and use satellite images and other information to develop a forecast. “There are an enormous amount of predictive features, and every single one of them could be inaccurate in some way,” he said. “Building up a set of predictive models is a very complex problem.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Recent advances now make it possible to start developing a personal “health forecast.” “There’s been a lot of excitement over whether or not genetic variation could contribute to the probability that someone is likely to develop disease,” said Dr. Deo. “But probably there’s more to it than that. Maybe you want to start measuring protein levels in the bloodstream, over a couple different days, and bring in some family history and echocardiography data. Each of these will have some level of uncertainty to it.” However, by studying large groups of patients over time, and using supercomputers to help identify and analyze patterns that emerge, Dr. Deo hopes to develop models that could help doctors predict patients’ likelihood of a heart attack or the best ways to optimize their cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Among other collaborations, Dr. Deo will work with Dr. Gregory Marcus, the medical director of the new UCSF Cardiovascular Cohort, which will establish a large database and biospecimen bank to study the genetics, biomarkers and stem cells of a large group of patients with heart disease. “In many ways, you have to let the data say, ‘I think you should group me together,’” said Dr. Deo. “But that requires having enough traditional clinical information along with genetic data and measurements of proteins or metabolites in the bloodstream.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Seeing the Big Picture&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Deo received his medical degree from Weill Cornell Medical College and his PhD in biophysics from the Rockefeller University, both in New York, and completed his residency at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. He also completed a fellowship in cardiology and a postdoctoral fellowship in stem cell biology at Massachusetts General Hospital, and completed another postdoctoral fellowship in bioinformatics at Harvard.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;He will employ all this training as he pursues what is known as a systems biology or systems medicine approach. “Instead of looking for that magic single gene or single lab value that’s supposed to give you all possible predictive power, systems biology is an embracing of the fact that multiple things need to be measured in parallel,” said Dr. Deo. “Also, we need the ability to watch large cohorts of people over long periods of time. All other complex systems – like the weather – make us think that we will probably need more than a single measurement or time point to make useful predictions.”&lt;/p&gt;
			 
			&lt;p&gt;Systems biology is an emerging field that has been made possible in part by recent leaps in technology and science. “There have been developments in the level of computing power and memory storage, but in parallel, there have also been beautiful advances in statistics and computational approaches, and how to deal with problems of having large numbers of hypotheses,” said Dr. Deo. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p&gt;“I am just incredibly excited by the opportunities at UCSF,” he said. “There is a tremendous amount of energy between the clinical and research side, and this brand new building allows for a ready translation from the benchside to the clinic.” Dr. Deo will spend part of his time working in the UCSF Cardiovascular Genetics Clinic, seeing patients and their families with inherited cardiovascular disease. He is also setting up his laboratory, which will include both advanced computing systems as well as facilities to conduct cell culture experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;When not in the lab or seeing patients, Dr. Deo and his wife, Shamali, enjoy hiking and exploring San Francisco’s many restaurants. They are proud parents of a baby girl.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;His new position allows him to combine his many interests. “My father was a probability and statistics professor,” said Dr. Deo. “To bring my excitement over math and statistics to biological problems is a great opportunity.” Caring for patients as a cardiologist also fuels his scientific passions. “You see patients over many months and years, and the same problems are there,” he said. “You’d like to be able to do more, and that motivates you to pursue science.”&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;/div&gt;
			
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;In recent years, many new avenues have emerged for treating cardiac valve disease. Conditions such as mitral valve prolapse can be treated through open&#45;heart surgery, minimally invasive surgery, or sometimes without any surgery at all – instead inserting collapsible valves or clips through a small incision in the groin and placing them in the heart with catheters.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
			&quot;Nowadays, when we have so many options, it’s absolutely crucial that patients are seen by both a cardiologist and a heart surgeon who work together to determine the best treatment option for each patient,&quot; said Dr. Tobias Deuse, an adult cardiothoracic surgeon who recently joined the UCSF faculty and is the director of the minimally invasive cardiac surgery program. &quot;There are some procedures that cardiologists do, some that surgeons do, and some procedures that we do together because they involve both of our areas of expertise. With modern heart interventions, the line between cardiology and surgery has become less obvious.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Deuse was recruited from the University of Hamburg&#45;Eppendorf, one of the leading mitral valve centers in Germany. He is excited by UCSF’s team approach to complex heart disease, and recently led the establishment at UCSF of a combined clinic where patients see both an interventional cardiologist and cardiac surgeon on the same day; the specialists then consult with each other and tailor a treatment plan for each patient’s unique situation.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;If patients meet with a doctor who tells them one thing, and then the next doctor tells them something completely different, they go home confused and frustrated – it’s terrible!&quot; said Dr. Deuse. &quot;But when they see different specialists working together to develop an individualized plan for them, they feel much better. The hospitals that adapt this team approach will likely be most successful.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;Dr. Deuse has had excellent training and is a very gifted surgeon,&quot; said Dr. Scot Merrick, chief of the Division of Adult Cardiothoracic Surgery and the Helen and Charles Schwab Distinguished Professor in Surgery. &quot;He is also a very outgoing person, and is easy to get along with. That [combination] is hard to find in cardiac surgery circles. His interest in new technologies is going to be great. He has used a lot more devices in Germany than we have available here in the US, so he has a lot of experience with them and will bring a lot of new ideas.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Keeping His Day Job – And Night Job&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Deuse studied physics as an undergraduate at the University of Stuttgart in Germany, then earned his medical degree from Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich, where he also completed his cardiac surgery internship before completing his cardiovascular surgery residency at the University Heart Center in Hamburg&#45;Eppendorf, Germany. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;He was drawn very early to cardiothoracic surgery, in part because of a fascination with cardiac anatomy and the challenge of performing meticulous surgery that required tiny sutures. Even as a medical student, he started doing heart transplants on rats. It was there, 19 years ago, that he met Dr. Sonja Schrepfer, another medical student who became his lifelong research partner and eventually his wife. &quot;It was very romantic, meeting in the basement in the animal OR!&quot; said Dr. Deuse with a laugh. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Deuse later completed a cardiothoracic surgery transplant fellowship at Stanford University, a pioneering center in the areas of heart and heart&#45;lung transplantation. Among his mentors were Dr. Bruce Reitz, Dr. Philip Oyer and Dr. Craig Miller. Dr. Deuse was then recruited back to Germany, where he served as director of the heart and lung transplantation program at the University of Hamburg&#45;Eppendorf and also practiced as a general cardiac surgeon.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Throughout his career, Dr. Deuse likes to joke that he has had two jobs. His day job is performing elective cardiac surgery. His night and weekend job is performing heart, lung and heart&#45;lung transplants, during the off hours when operating rooms are available for these unscheduled, life&#45;changing procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Deuse has always juggled a third job, too – in partnership with Dr. Schrepfer, now a renowned stem cell scientist and immunobiologist, he has conducted vascular biology research with the goal of finding better ways to prevent cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Complex Mitral Valve Repair&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In Hamburg, Dr. Deuse’s &quot;day job&quot; included performing hundreds of heart surgeries, with a focus on reconstructive valve surgery. Perhaps three&#45;quarters of these procedures are complex mitral valve repairs – fixing problems of the valve between the left atrium and left ventricle. &quot;Mitral valve repair is really interesting, because it’s demanding, and no two valves are exactly the same,&quot; said Dr. Deuse. &quot;For each one, you have to come up with a strategy, which may be very different from the last case you did.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The mitral valve is a parachute&#45;like structure, with two leaflets that open and close a bit like a pair of French doors, and which are connected to the inside of the heart by a number of chords. When the leaflets fail to close together tightly, blood in the left ventricle can flow backwards to the left atrium, compromising blood flow to the rest of the body. Dr. Deuse comes up with a tailored solution for each valve he repairs. For example, if part of a leaflet is calcified and doesn’t bend properly, Dr. Deuse can modify the other leaflet so together they form a tight seal. If the chords which pull the leaflets open and close are ruptured, he can insert artificial Gore&#45;Tex chords to replace them.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;There is a lot you can do to fix valves, which is why most of them can be repaired,&quot; said Dr. Deuse. Repair of a patient’s own valve is preferable to replacement, since bioprosthetic valves – such as those from pigs or cows – degenerate over time, and patients younger than 65 may eventually need a second valve replacement. Mechanical valves, which are made from metal and carbon, can last longer, but require patients to take a blood thinner to prevent clotting around the valve. &quot;A nicely repaired valve can last a lifetime,&quot; said Dr. Deuse, noting that for cases where repair is not possible, he and his team can also replace the valve.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Minimally Invasive Approaches&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;For valve surgery, Dr. Deuse specializes in minimally invasive approaches. Whereas traditional open surgery usually involves a long incision through the center of the chest, which cuts through the breastbone and requires several weeks to heal, he has significant experience in using smaller incisions. Through these &quot;keyhole&quot; incisions, he inserts long&#45;handled surgical instruments and three&#45;dimensional endoscopes, which allow him to view the surgical site on a video screen as he performs the procedure. These incisions can be made in between the ribs, so no bones need to be cut. &quot;If we can avoid opening up the sternum, patients maintain a fully functioning and stable chest,&quot; said Dr. Deuse. &quot;That allows patients – especially those who are frail and elderly – to rehabilitate and mobilize more quickly.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			 
			&lt;p&gt;For example, patients recovering from open cardiac procedures should avoid lifting suitcases and other heavier items or using their arms to help them walk for eight weeks, due to the risk of reopening their surgical incision and thereby increasing the chances of wound infection. By contrast, patients who have minimally invasive surgery are allowed to move freely and use their arms as soon as they feel up to it.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Contrary to conventional wisdom, minimally invasive surgery is feasible even in overweight patients. &quot;It’s absolutely true that it’s much harder to do in obese patients,&quot; said Dr. Deuse, noting that surgical instruments need to be inserted through a deeper incision to get to such patients’ hearts, and there is less room to maneuver because the internal organs push the patient’s diaphragm higher into the chest cavity. &quot;But very obese patients benefit very much from this approach, because they’re at even higher risk of wound infections and have more difficulty standing up and moving after the procedure due to their weight. Because it can benefit such patients, it’s worth the effort.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Deuse has given workshops for minimally invasive mitral valve repair, where he trained other heart surgeons on the procedure. Usually in two&#45;day events, the participants learned about the theory behind valve repair and could then watch live cases in the OR.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Innovations in Heart Transplantation and Assist Devices&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Before joining the UCSF faculty this year, Dr. Deuse directed the heart and lung transplantation program at the University Heart Center Hamburg, and developed expertise with new technologies and devices. For example, because donor hearts are unable to tolerate prolonged periods of time without blood supply, they are usually stored on ice during transit and should be implanted within four hours after retrieval from the donor. To improve preservation of the heart and enable transportation of donor organs over longer distances, a new technology called ex vivo heart perfusion (nicknamed &quot;heart in a box&quot;) has been developed. This portable box connects the donor heart with a temporary blood supply, allowing the heart to keep beating and receiving oxygen as it travels to its destination.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;This technology was recently tested in several countries, and Dr. Deuse’s program was among the largest enrollers for the German national trial. &quot;The technology is reliable and not only improves organ preservation, but also allows a functional assessment of the heart while it is connected to the device,&quot; said Dr. Deuse. &quot;However, the high costs and laborious operation of the device so far preclude a widespread use of this technology.&quot; The device is commercially available in Europe, but is still under clinical investigation in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Because of the scarcity of donor hearts, only a fraction of patients with end&#45;stage heart failure will receive a heart transplant. One alternative or &quot;bridge to transplant&quot; procedure is the implantation of a ventricular assist device (VAD), a miniaturized pump that can help patients whose own hearts are unable to keep up with the body’s need for oxygenated blood. &quot;Just a few years ago, we had these big pneumatic devices which were large, heavy and noisy,&quot; said Dr. Deuse. &quot;But modern VADs are becoming a better and better option for heart failure patients.&quot;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The latest generation of VADs are smaller than ever before, feature continuous flow pumps rather than the bulkier pulsatile pumps, and can be a good option when patients might otherwise die waiting for a donor heart. Because of his experience with keyhole cardiac surgery, Dr. Deuse established minimally invasive techniques for VAD implantation as well. At UCSF, he joins Dr. Georg Wieselthaler, an internationally renowned expert in the development and implantation of VADs as well as in heart transplantation.
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Preventing Heart Attacks&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Deuse is also passionate about the research he conducts with Dr. Schrepfer, which currently focuses on new strategies to prevent restenosis of coronary arteries. This occurs when the blood vessels feeding the heart re&#45;narrow after an intervention such as an angioplasty, which uses inflatable balloons and stents to push plaque against the artery walls to restore blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Scientists now believe this process is not so much like a gradually clogging sewer pipe, but happens because of inflammation in the artery wall. Specifically, the smooth muscle cells –which are the main cell population of the arterial wall – proliferate and become resistant to obeying signals to commit suicide when required for the body to maintain overall health. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;We looked at the growth characteristics of these hard&#45;to&#45;control proliferative cells, and found so many similarities to cancer growth,&quot; said Dr. Deuse. In particular, they identified a &quot;switch&quot; that seems to trigger the transformation of normal cells into out&#45;of&#45;control cells that are implicated in restenosis. Drs. Deuse and Schrepfer have begun a clinical trial in Germany with angioplasty patients to test a new class of restenosis inhibitors; these borrow a page from the cancer medication playbook in their method of taming uncontrolled growth.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;So far, we couldn’t find any major side effects or disadvantages of this treatment,&quot; said Dr. Deuse. &quot;If we can apply even more localized approaches – such as using these inhibitors as a stent coating – I think this will make any side effects even more unlikely.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Deuse counts himself lucky to collaborate with a full&#45;time lab scientist. &quot;Since we met in medical school 19 years ago, Dr. Schrepfer and I have done all our research together,&quot; he said. &quot;It makes it a little easier for me to come to the lab whenever I have time, because she fills in the gaps when I am not around.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Deuse is also an enthusiastic educator, and has been inspired by his own mentors, such as Dr. Reitz at Stanford. &quot;You learn the technique when you work with him, but you get so much of the spirit that’s behind this, and it’s contagious,&quot; said Dr. Deuse. &quot;When I teach, I try to make the residents or fellows dig deep and understand the basic principles of the disease, and the strategy behind what we are doing. It’s more than just sewing parts together. It’s asking, ‘Why are we doing it this way, and not another way?’ It’s almost like learning a language – rather than learning words by rote, helping them understand where the words come from, and what are their roots.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Incredible Potential&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;He and Dr. Schrepfer are excited to join the UCSF faculty. &quot;The research institutions here are phenomenal,&quot; he said. &quot;The combination of excellence in clinical care, cutting&#45;edge basic science, and the many bright people clustered here at UCSF is just incredible. It doesn’t get any better than this.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;When he is not working at his day, night or weekend jobs, Dr. Deuse enjoys running, cycling and cheering on the Golden State Warriors.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin&#45;left:15px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/ucsfhealthcardiology.ucsf.edu/files/images/fleischmann.jpg&quot; class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Photo credit: Elisabeth Fall&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;&quot;There are often many options in medicine,&quot; said Dr. Kirsten Fleischmann. &quot;We usually ask, 'What can we do?' but the more difficult question is sometimes, 'What should we do?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Fleischmann has devoted much of her career to finding answers to these questions. &quot;We're lucky in cardiology that we have many good ways to investigate the heart,&quot; she said, noting that today's tools include echocardiography, which is ultrasound of the heart; computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); various forms of stress testing; and angiography and catheter&#45;based testing, which involves inserting flexible tubes called catheters through the blood vessels to the heart. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;But with all these options, it becomes critical to understand the pros and cons of each test and how they can best be used to optimize outcomes important to our patients, be that minimizing the risk of another heart attack or preserving quality of life,&quot; said Dr. Fleischmann. &quot;And since all tests come with costs, whether they are risks to the patient, potential side effects, or money, it's important to understand how we can use our arsenal of tests most effectively and efficiently. This has become a growing emphasis in medicine – to do the right thing as efficiently as possible.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;One of her interests as a cardiovascular outcomes researcher has been evaluating different types of non&#45;invasive cardiology tests and their relationship to patient outcomes. She and her colleagues have studied how each type of test measures up, their relative strengths and limitations, and patients' long&#45;term outcomes. &quot;Some of the questions we tried to answer were, if a certain type of stress test comes back as normal, what's the 'warranty period' on that test?&quot; asked Dr. Fleischmann. &quot;Who develops a cardiac event in the future? These are very practical, important issues to help us use tests most effectively.&quot; Their research has produced a number of high&#45;profile publications that measure the utility and cost&#45;effectiveness of such tests, and can help clinicians select which tests are best equipped to assess a specific patient's heart health.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Building on this work, Dr. Fleischmann and her collaborators are investigating the optimal ways to identify patients in the asymptomatic population who are most at risk for developing heart disease. &quot;How do we best decide who benefits from interventions, such as taking a daily aspirin or lowering their cholesterol with medications?&quot; she said. &quot;Who can forego these measures safely? How can testing help? In general, we match the intensity of medical therapy to risk, and I hope to identify better ways to stratify patients' risk.&quot; 
			
			&lt;p&gt;One patient population that is at increased risk of developing heart disease is people with diabetes. Currently, most diabetic patients are treated as if they have atherosclerosis, or plaque buildup in the arteries which narrows these blood vessels. &quot;More and more, however, we're coming to understand that there is a spectrum in that risk,&quot; said Dr. Fleischmann. &quot;Some  patients with diabetes are at exceptionally high risk and some at relatively low risk.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The amount of calcium deposited in the blood vessels which supply the heart roughly correlates with the severity of atherosclerosis. Dr. Fleischmann and her colleagues are investigating whether using a CT scan to measure a patient's calcium score can help cardiologists make better decisions about treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Improving Hospital Care&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In addition to learning how non&#45;invasive cardiology tests can best support preventive care, Dr. Fleischmann is also interested in how they can best help patients in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;Chest pain and shortness of breath are so common, and they drive many emergency department visits and hospitalizations,&quot; she said. &quot;But those symptoms have many different causes. Some cases are quite serious and, in fact, heart&#45;related. Others are benign.&quot; Among other findings, her research suggests that patients with left ventricular dysfunction or mitral valve regurgitation are most likely to have short&#45;term complications in the hospital, as well as poorer long&#45;term outcomes. Her team also found that slightly increased levels of a protein called troponin, even outside the context of clear&#45;cut heart&#45;related symptoms, were associated with increased risk of death or heart attack within one year.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Fleischmann also collaborated with Dr. Barbara Drew in the School of Nursing to study whether using enhanced electrocardiograms – which collect more comprehensive data than standard electrocardiograms – can improve evaluation of patients in the emergency department who complain of chest pain. &quot;One of the joys of my research career is having my own focus and programs, but also collaborating across disciplines and schools,&quot; she said. &quot;UCSF's depth and breadth allows me to develop projects where my colleagues' interests overlap with mine.&quot; She also collaborates internationally with investigators at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, in work that has been supported by the US National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Yet another area of interest is improving the cardiac management of surgical patients. &quot;Even noncardiac surgery can be a stress on the cardiovascular system,&quot; said Dr. Fleischmann. &quot;How do we minimize cardiac complications around noncardiac surgery? It's a fascinating area.&quot; Years ago, she was asked to serve on a committee charged with developing guidelines in this area. The group sifts through the best evidence, weighs sometimes conflicting studies carefully, and has developed nuanced recommendations based on the estimated risk of a particular patient. She has continued to serve in leadership positions with updates of those guidelines, and has also worked with hospitalist Dr. Andrew Auerbach to improve the use of medications to prevent cardiac complications in surgical patients.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;From the Lab to Clinical Research&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Fleischmann was born near Akron, Ohio, and earned degrees in both chemistry and music at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. She thought she would pursue a doctorate in chemistry, but worked a summer job at University Hospitals of Cleveland. &quot;I became immediately fascinated by all the intellectually stimulating aspects of medicine, as well as the way it stretched you emotionally and had an immediate impact on people's lives,&quot; she said. &quot;Just sitting across from a patient makes it important.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;She decided to become a doctor, earning her medical degree from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, where she also did her internal medicine residency. She became fascinated by the pathophysiology of cardiology – the underlying physical mechanisms causing various disorders of the heart – and found the large array of cardiac procedures and interventions appealing. &quot;In cardiology, there's a lot you can do for the patient,&quot; said Dr. Fleischmann. &quot;I like the process of thinking through problems to get to the right diagnosis, and then having effective treatments to offer.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Fleischmann continued her interest in basic science, and worked in a molecular biology laboratory at the Max Planck Institute in Bad Nauheim, Germany after residency. She returned to the U.S., where she did her cardiology fellowship at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;I had not been exposed to much clinical research, so I decided to seek out clinical research experiences and get some training in research methods by participating in the summer&#45;long Clinical Effectiveness Program at the Harvard School of Public Health,&quot; said Dr. Fleischmann. She enjoyed the experience so much that she decided to become a clinical researcher focused on understanding what tests and treatments improve outcomes for patients with heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;She also earned a Master's in Public Health degree from the Harvard School of Public Health while she worked her day jobs as a fellow and later an associate physician at the Brigham. &quot;It helped that the School of Public Health is essentially just across a courtyard from the hospital,&quot; said Dr. Fleischmann. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;She joined the UCSF faculty in 1998, recruited by Dr. Lee Goldman, a cardiologist and clinical effectiveness pioneer who was then Chair of the Department of Medicine and Dr. William Grossman, Chief of the Division of Cardiology. &quot;Dr. Goldman and Dr. Grossman were interested in supporting cardiovascular outcomes research at UCSF, and the opportunity to build a program here was very attractive,&quot; said Dr. Fleischmann. &quot;The weather didn't hurt either.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Being Wholly Present for Patients&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In addition to her research on clinical outcomes and cost&#45;effectiveness, Dr. Fleischmann has a busy clinical schedule. She sees patients in the Mission Bay clinic, performs and interprets echocardiograms, supervises stress tests in the Non&#45;Invasive Stress Laboratory, and oversees the care of hospitalized patients in the Intensive Cardiac Care Unit as well as serving on the inpatient cardiac consult service. She also serves as Medical Director for the Cardiac Stress Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;I find restoring someone to health and supporting them in their efforts to live a healthy life is very satisfying,&quot; said Dr. Fleischmann. &quot;I also love seeing my long&#45;term patients in the clinic with their family and friends, and learning about their home life, goals and aspirations. Part of my job as a physician is to educate, support and help my patients. As a doctor, I am a trusted source of information. I make sure that patients are aware of risk factors and what they can do about them. I let them know about proven treatments and therapies. It's a partnership between doctor and patient.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;As a specialist in non&#45;invasive cardiology testing, she spends a lot of time in the Echocardiography Lab. &quot;Even after all these years, I love looking at the heart,&quot; said Dr. Fleischmann. &quot;It's endlessly fascinating. We can get so much information from non&#45;invasive tests, which are relatively low&#45;risk to the patient. Those tests can tell us about the structure and function of the heart, how well it works as a pump, whether it can relax normally, how the valves are working, and whether there is fluid buildup around the heart. Our cardiology fellows tease me because I still get so excited when I see something interesting. I'll say, 'Wow, look at that!' or 'That's gorgeous!'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Fleischmann teaches throughout everything she does, whether in formal lectures, in the Echocardiography Lab, or at the bedside. &quot;We are very lucky to have amazing trainees here,&quot; she said. &quot;It's a privilege to work with them and pass on what I've learned. It's also very rewarding when trainees think through a problem and figure it out on their own. To see the light go on for them is very satisfying.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;She advises trainees to find something they love to do, and to take good care of themselves. &quot;Training is a marathon, not a sprint,&quot; said Dr. Fleischmann. &quot;It's only by taking care of ourselves that we can be there wholly for our patients.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Outside of medicine, Dr. Fleischmann enjoys spending time with her family and all styles of music. A mezzo&#45;soprano, she has been a church singer for many years, and loves singing Lieder, oratorio and opera.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/ucsfhealthcardiology.ucsf.edu/files/images/foster&#45;spotlight.png&quot; style=&quot;margin&#45;top:10px;max&#45;width:100%;&quot; class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Photo credit: Elisabeth Fall.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Dr. Elyse Foster, a pioneer in adult congenital heart disease and the field of echocardiography, has witnessed many transformations in the care of patients born with heart defects – as well as the field of medicine itself.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;The year I started medical school, 20 percent of the class were women,&quot; said Dr. Foster, Araxe Vilensky Endowed Chair in Medicine, who earned her medical degree at Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston in 1977. Just two years before, only 10 percent of the entering class were female. &quot;With the women's movement, it was inspiring to see that [medicine] was something that many women were doing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Foster was born in Brooklyn and grew up on Long Island. She attended Tufts as an undergraduate, originally planning to study early childhood education or special education. That all changed when she befriended a number of pre&#45;med students who were women. By her sophomore year, Dr. Foster decided to pursue medicine, and majored in psychology. Through her volunteer work at a women's clinic in Boston and the emergency department at Massachusetts General Hospital, she also met women doctors for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;She decided to pursue a career in cardiology because she enjoyed reading electrocardiograms and caring for heart attack patients, and had a number of inspiring cardiology mentors during residency, including Dr. Carl Apstein and Dr. Laura Wexler. Dr. Foster completed her internal medicine residency and cardiology fellowship at Boston University, where she was only the third woman to become a cardiology fellow. This disparity was reflected throughout the field. &quot;We would go to cardiology meetings, and it would be seas of men,&quot; said Dr. Foster. &quot;It was the only time you never had to wait in line for the women's room, because there were so few of us!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Adult Congenital Heart Disease: Lifelong Care&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;She joined the Boston University cardiology faculty, then was recruited to the UCSF cardiology faculty in 1989. For many years, she directed the adult echocardiography laboratory – which uses ultrasound of the heart to diagnose and help guide treatment of patients at UCSF Medical Center. She also led the Adult Congenital Heart Disease Service for almost two decades, which cares for the burgeoning population of patients with heart defects who are now living into adulthood, thanks to improved surgical treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;She is a giant in the field of echocardiography,&quot; said Dr. Jeffrey Olgin, chief of the Division of Cardiology and Ernest Gallo&#45;Kanu Chatterjee Distinguished Professor in Clinical Cardiology. &quot;In addition to building a world&#45;class echo lab at UCSF and helping start one of the first adult congenital heart disease clinics, she has trained generations of echocardiographers.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;The whole field of adult congenital heart disease has grown from a very small field to an established subspecialty of cardiology,&quot; said Dr. Foster. &quot;A lot of the operations for congenital heart disease were developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and there are still ongoing modifications to many of these surgeries. We've seen these patients grow up and create their own new natural history, because we didn't know what the long&#45;term outcomes would be.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;For example, in the early 1990s, cyanotic or &quot;blue&quot; babies whose heart malformations prevented their blood from being fully oxygenated had 90 percent mortality by age 10. Today, 90 percent survive until age 20. &quot;What we couldn't anticipate were the late problems associated with their surgeries,&quot; said Dr. Foster. &quot;For patients who were born with a single ventricle, would that ventricle fail? Was the [original] operation they had going to create so many long&#45;term problems that their outcomes would be poor in the long run?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Foster has followed a cohort of patients for 20 years, some of whom had heart surgery at UCSF, and others who have moved here as adults. Many of her patients are now in their 50s, and one of her oldest patients is now more than 70 years old. &quot;It's an incredible field,&quot; said Dr. Foster. &quot;Patients usually transition from their pediatric cardiologist to us between ages 20 and 25. We have the privilege of following many patients through marriage, pregnancy, childbirth, and hopefully into old age. It's a lifelong relationship.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Foster works with a large network of colleagues to care for these complex patients, including specialists in cardiac arrhythmias, electrophysiology and heart failure, as well as obstetrics and gynecology, pulmonology, and other fields. &quot;This group of patients requires a village of physicians and health care professionals to care for them,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Many patients with congenital heart disease have surgery as infants or children and enjoy relatively typical childhoods, but do not get adequate care once they leave for college or move away from home. &quot;Because of the success of the procedures, they feel healthy, but are lost to follow&#45;up until they get into trouble because suddenly something like an abnormal heart rhythm occurs,&quot; said Dr. Foster. &quot;Then they present at some community hospital emergency room, and the people there don't understand their disease. Identifying these patients and getting them back into specialized care is really important.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Foster has been a leader in these efforts nationally. She co&#45;wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/123/13/1454.full.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;guidelines published by the American Heart Association (AHA)&lt;/a&gt; on how to best manage medical and psychosocial transitions to adulthood for adolescents with congenital heart disease. She also co&#45;authored a scientific statement for the AHA on the diagnosis and treatment of older adults with congenital heart disease. In addition, she has served on the board of directors and medical advisory board of the Adult Congenital Heart Association, a patient advocacy group.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;She has seen giant leaps forward in the care of adult congenital heart disease patients. Many patients have scar tissue on their hearts from prior heart surgeries, which can cause abnormal heart rhythms. Often, these can now be treated through ablation, in which an electrophysiologist strategically burns or freezes small areas of the heart to isolate rogue electrical currents. Another major innovation has been the development of catheter&#45;based therapies to patch holes in the heart or replace malfunctioning heart valves. Because this approach is done by inserting devices into blood vessels and snaking them up to the heart rather than through open&#45;heart surgery, they broaden the treatment options for patients who have already endured multiple open&#45;heart surgeries as children.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Foster has been a lead investigator of the MitraClip system, which uses a device that is inserted through a catheter to repair a leaky mitral valve – a bit like using a tiny clothespin to secure loose valve flaps, preventing backflow of blood in the heart. Her group has also studied the effectiveness of biventricular pacing to treat heart failure, in which a special kind of pacemaker helps the heart contract in a more coordinated and efficient way.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Solving Puzzles with Echocardiography&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Foster is also an expert in echocardiography, which is used to diagnose and treat many forms of heart disease. &quot;Ultrasound of the heart is important for every aspect of cardiology,&quot; she said. &quot;It provides a wealth of information about cardiac structure and function, and the pressure in the heart. It's also very useful, because it's non&#45;invasive, relatively inexpensive, widely available, and portable – it can be done at the bedside, in the operating room or in the emergency room.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;For example, &quot;broken heart syndrome&quot; or stress&#45;induced cardiomyopathy was just identified a few decades ago. It more frequently affects women than men, and is characterized by chest pain and shortness of breath that is brought on by an emotionally or physically stressful event. Patients often think they are having a heart attack. However, the condition causes a signature ballooning in the bottom tip of the heart, which can be seen on an echocardiogram. &quot;I had this patient in her 90s whose house had a rat infestation, and she was very upset about it and developed chest pain,&quot; said Dr. Foster. &quot;I saw her in the emergency room, put the echo probe on her chest, and said, ‘I know what you have!' I have seen her a couple times since, and she has perfect heart function now.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;When teaching trainees, Dr. Foster emphasizes the importance of using echocardiography and other tools to better understand the big picture. &quot;More than anything, we need to place the results of the echocardiogram in the context of the patient and their clinical problem,&quot; she said. &quot;What is the chief complaint, what do we know about underlying diseases, and how can we integrate the findings on the echocardiogram into the diagnosis and care of the patient? When things don't fit together, you've got to work out that puzzle.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;For example, she and her colleagues published a case in the New England Journal of Medicine about a patient with severe heart failure of mysterious origin. The echocardiogram showed that the heart was actually squeezing very well, which didn't make sense given her other symptoms. They eventually discovered that she had an arteriovenous fistula – a rare condition in which the arteries and veins are directly connected, rather than being separated by small blood vessels called capillaries. A UCSF vascular surgeon performed a nine&#45;hour surgery to repair the fistula, and the patient's heart failure melted away. &quot;It was important to look at the echocardiogram with a very critical eye and say, ‘Wait a second, something is out of the ordinary,'&quot; said Dr. Foster. &quot;It's an example of putting all the data together and paying attention to subtle findings.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Foster is an enthusiastic teacher, and has mentored generations of cardiologists. &quot;Sitting down with an attending like Dr. Foster and having her go through each echo from start to finish is amazing,&quot; said Dr. Nalini Colaco, a first&#45;year cardiology fellow at UCSF. &quot;There were so many things that I wouldn't be able to pick up on my own that she showed us how to work through. And when she sees an interesting echo, she'll call us all over and say, ‘Look at this! It's something you should see and know.' You can really sense when someone wants to teach you, and when they are so willing to give their time to engage with you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;It has been a privilege to train and work with Dr. Foster,&quot; said Dr. Ian Harris, director of the UCSF Adult Congenital Cardiology Program. &quot;In addition to being a world&#45;class echocardiographer and top&#45;notch clinician, she is an exceptional teacher and mentor. I owe my entry into the field of adult congenital cardiology to her, and am indebted to her for her invaluable support and guidance over the years.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;During nearly two decades as chief of the UCSF Echocardiography Laboratory, Elyse Foster has melded extraordinary administrative instincts and exceptional clinical acumen,&quot; said Dr. Nelson B. Schiller, John J. Sampson and Lucie Stern Chair in Cardiology, who founded the UCSF Echocardiography Laboratory and the UCSF Adult Congenital Heart Disease Clinic. &quot;As a result, the laboratory has maintained its position of world leadership while providing unwaveringly excellent services. The extraordinary growth in demand for echocardiography examinations of ever&#45;increasing complexity stands as testimony to Dr. Foster's effective stewardship. In parallel, she has developed a competitive advanced training program for post&#45;fellowship physicians seeking training in congenital and standard imaging. UCSF Cardiology has been most fortunate to have benefitted so richly from her dedicated efforts.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Looking to the Future&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Foster plans to retire later this year, but will continue to work part&#45;time in the echocardiography lab, see patients with congenital heart disease and structural heart defects, and continue her research into better treatments for valve disease. She also plans to continue her collaboration with the Adult Congenital Heart Association to promote education for physicians and adults with congenital heart disease and improve transitions between pediatric and adult cardiology for such patients. In addition, she will continue her work with the California Department of Public Health to reduce pregnancy&#45;related mortality related to congenital heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Foster's entire family is involved in medicine: her husband, Dr. William Shalen, recently retired as a physician at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Richmond; her daughter, Dr. Julia Shalen, graduated from the UCSF School of Medicine and is currently a pediatric intern at UCSF; and her son, Dr. Evan Shalen, graduated from Boston University School of Medicine and is now a second&#45;year internal medicine resident at UCSF. Dr. Foster is also excited to spend time with her first grandchild, Finn, who was born in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin&#45;left:15px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/ucsfhealthcardiology.ucsf.edu/files/images/fung.jpg&quot; class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Photo credit: Elisabeth Fall&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;&quot;In Buddhism and Taoism, people don’t see illness as a problem of a body organ gone awry,&quot; said cardiologist Dr. Gordon Fung. &quot;Instead, it’s a total imbalance of energies, and people focus on eating the right foods or other activities to take care of that imbalance.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In San Francisco, where one in three residents is Asian, Dr. Fung serves as a bridge between patients with a traditional world view and the latest advances in cardiovascular medicine.
			
			&lt;p&gt;He was recruited to UCSF in 2000, where he founded the Asian Heart and Vascular Center to address barriers to care that he witnessed during his 15 years in private practice. Dr. Fung is deeply rooted in the community – a third&#45;generation San Franciscan, he was born at Chinese Hospital in Chinatown, attended Lowell High School, then earned his bachelor’s degree in economics from UC Berkeley, where he later earned a master’s degree in public health with a focus on hospital economics and administration.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;He comes from a family of doctors – his father graduated from the UCSF School of Medicine, and his siblings include a pharmacist, a radiologist and a gastroenterologist. Dr. Fung earned his medical degree from UCSF, then completed his internal medicine residency and chief residency at Highland General Hospital in Oakland and his cardiology fellowship at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Martinez.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;From 1985 until 2000, he practiced as an invasive cardiologist at California Pacific Medical Center and St. Mary’s Hospital. He also worked as an internist and general cardiologist at Chinese Hospital and Saint Francis Memorial Hospital, as well as seeing patients at his own private practice in Chinatown.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Those experiences sparked his curiosity about cultural barriers to health care among Asian patients, inspiring Dr. Fung to earn a PhD in East Asian religions from the California Institute of Integral Studies. &quot;I wondered if there was a philosophical reason why people didn’t want to have treatment or become involved in research trials, or favored traditional Chinese medicine,&quot; he said. Dr. Fung developed a better contextual understanding of why some patients use acupuncture or herbs, and how they may feel responsible for their condition. &quot;In a study of potential research subjects, some people believed that illness occurred because of karmic return – that they were being punished by their ancestors for poor behavior,&quot; said Dr. Fung.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Cultural beliefs also affect the way many Asians interface with the Western medical system. &quot;The Asian population is so courteous and respects physicians that they are reluctant to tell the doctor that a prescribed medication didn’t work or is causing side effects,&quot; said Dr. Fung. &quot;Instead, they just see somebody else, or they stop taking the medication and don’t say anything about it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;To counter this trend, Dr. Fung personally calls patients who miss an appointment. &quot;Most patients say they have never had a call from a physician before, and they ask, ‘Why are you calling? Am I that sick?’&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;One of the most important parts of providing effective care to his Asian patients is asking them why they think they have a particular problem. &quot;That can be very revealing,&quot; said Dr. Fung. &quot;For example, in the Confucian way of thinking, there is a protocol of how people should behave in families. When they don’t behave as they should, it can cause suffering. Many people can be educated so they understand that their beliefs are important, but there is also a completely medical approach that we can use to intervene on their condition.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Fung also talks with them about their diet. For example, although Asians tend to not use table salt, many of the sauces used in cooking are loaded with sodium, which can exacerbate hypertension and heart failure. He cautions patients on blood thinners from receiving acupuncture, suggesting that they consider acupressure instead. He also asks them about all their medications, including over&#45;the&#45;counter pills and traditional herbs they might be taking. &quot;We once had a young woman with her baby come in with horrendous cardiac arrhythmias,&quot; said Dr. Fung. &quot;When we sent off blood tests for toxins and drugs, we found toxic levels of digoxin. We determined that it must have come from the herbs she was taking. So we always ask if they are on herbs.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Improving Asian Heart Health&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The Asian Heart and Vascular Center is based at Mount Zion as well as Dr. Fung’s community practice in Chinatown, and treats many patients from China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Japan, and Korea, as well Hawaiian Islanders and Pacific Islanders. Dr. Fung uses a translator for about 30 percent of his patients, and is fluent in Cantonese. Other team members include electrophysiologists Dr. Randall Lee, Dr. Byron Lee and Dr. Zian Tseng, as well as heart and lung surgeon Dr. Elaine Tseng, who is based at the San Francisco Veterans Administration Medical Center and can help refer patients who need surgical care.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;One of the most common problems Dr. Fung sees in his patients is uncontrolled hypertension. As director of the UCSF Resistant Hypertension Clinic, his goal to get these patients to target to help prevent heart attack, stroke and other events.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The definition of resistant hypertension is high blood pressure which is still uncontrolled despite taking three hypertension medications, one of which should be a diuretic (or &quot;water pill&quot;). &quot;Many patients, including some that were coming over from China, were walking around with markedly elevated blood pressures of 170 or 180,&quot; said Dr. Fung. &quot;They thought that because they were on small doses of medication, they were fine. It’s been important to educate both patients and physicians about the importance of titrating medications up to lower their blood pressure to target.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Another challenge has been the high percentage of Asian patients who have adverse reactions to some commonly prescribed hypertension medications. For example, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors cause what is known as an ACE&#45;induced cough in about 5 percent of the general population. &quot;In East Asian patients, it’s been reported as high as 50 percent,&quot; said Dr. Fung. &quot;Patients just wouldn’t take the medication because of the cough. Once we prescribe a different medication that they could tolerate, we can often get their hypertension under control.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Similarly, many of his patients also develop gouty arthritis associated with the diuretics used to control blood pressure. &quot;Acute gout is very painful, and if patients feel that it’s related to their medications, they are likely to stop taking them,&quot; said Dr. Fung. &quot;We’ve been working with our physician colleagues to choose a diuretic for their Asian patients which is less likely to create side effects like gout.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Some other conditions that appear to occur with greater frequency in Asian populations include:&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diffuse coronary artery disease: Most patients with coronary artery disease have an acute blockage which can often be opened by a balloon angioplasty or stent. However, Asian patients often have diffuse coronary artery disease, which means that the acute blockage is surrounded by lesser but still significant narrowing of the surrounding blood vessels. &quot;We don’t have enough information to know what measures to take to prevent recurrence of coronary artery disease in these patients, or whether Asians are more at risk of that,&quot; said Dr. Fung. More research is required to determine whether Asians have genetic mutations or other factors that might affect how effective statins are in preventing recurrence of disease.
			
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increased risk of bleeding: As a group, Asians tend to have increased sensitivity to blood thinners such as warfarin, aspirin and clopidogrel (also known as Plavix). &quot;Some Asian patients only require a milligram or two of warfarin to achieve full anticoagulation, whereas the average American usually needs five to 10 milligrams,&quot; said Dr. Fung. Asian patients who are taking aspirin are also more likely to experience diffuse bleeding during surgery. Dr. Alan Wu, director of the Clinical Chemistry and Toxicology Laboratories at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, is currently working on developing tests to help identify Asian patients who are at increased risk of complications with blood thinners.
			
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Metabolic disease: Asians are at higher risk for pre&#45;diabetes, diabetes and metabolic syndrome, which can also increase risk of cardiovascular disease. &quot;For many Asians, there is a paradox of having patients who are fairly thin – certainly not at the BMI (body mass index) standards of obese – and yet still having all the risk factors of insulin resistance,&quot; said Dr. Fung. Asians also frequently have increased amounts of fat locked in the abdomen, rather than throughout the body, as more commonly seen in Caucasian populations; this may be related to increased incidence of metabolic disease.
			
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strokes: Some studies have suggested that compared with the general population, East Asians experience more strokes than coronary artery disease as the presentation of cardiovascular disease. They also more frequently experience blockages and ruptures of blood vessels in the intracranial arteries, which are more complicated to treat than carotid artery disease in the neck.
			
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brugada syndrome: This is an inherited form of heart disease which produces potentially life&#45;threatening abnormal heart rhythms. &quot;Brugada syndrome appears to be more common in the Asian population, so it’s important to detect people with that electrocardiogram abnormality, refer them to our electrophysiology service and have them tested,&quot; said Dr. Fung. &quot;Because we have the ability to do genetic studies, we can also determine whether other family members might be affected.&quot;
			
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Asians appear to have a higher likelihood of developing this condition, in which the apex – the lowest part of the heart – becomes abnormally thickened. &quot;The enlargement can result in a smaller left ventricular cavity, which can then cause symptoms of heart failure,&quot; said Dr. Fung.
			
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Valvular disease: Rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease can damage the heart valves, requiring replacement later in life. Rheumatic fever usually starts out as strep throat, but prompt administration of antibiotics can usually prevent progression into rheumatic fever and subsequent heart disease. &quot;In the United States, rheumatic heart disease has essentially been eliminated as a problem, but there is still a high incidence of rheumatic heart disease throughout the entire Pacific Rim area,&quot; said Dr. Fung.
			
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Valve replacement: In recent years, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has offered an alternative to open&#45;heart surgery to replace defective heart valves. Using an approach similar to stents, cardiologists thread tiny cameras, instruments and a replacement valve through blood vessels in the groin or wrist up to the heart. However, because of the smaller architecture of their aorta and blood vessels and difficulty accessing the heart through the aorta, Asian patients more frequently require the cardiologist to perform a left ventricular puncture from the apex, where the replacement valve is inserted through the heart wall.
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The Asian Heart and Vascular Center is also a key partner of UCSF Medical Center’s Asian Health Institute, which seeks to promote research, education and patient care across all areas of health, including cardiovascular disease, hepatitis B and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Partnering with the Community&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;From his prior work as a community physician, Dr. Fung knows that some doctors are reluctant to refer patients to UCSF because they fear that this will end their relationship with their patients. &quot;I always send a letter referring patients back to their primary care physician,&quot; said Dr. Fung. &quot;I remind them to get their vaccines, manage their diabetes, and also make sure the patients see a dentist at least once a year.&quot; This is important, because dental cavities or gum disease is a source of chronic inflammation, which may increase inflammation in the blood vessels and contribute to atherosclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;If he had sufficient funds, Dr. Fung would be interested in conducting a large&#45;scale, longitudinal study investigating the genetics, environmental factors and cardiovascular outcomes of Asians who remain in their home countries compared with those who emigrate to the US. &quot;People develop a higher incidence of stroke and coronary disease once they come to the United States, but would they have the same incidence if they stayed in Asia?&quot; asked Dr. Fung. &quot;So far, this kind of study has only been done in smaller populations, and they haven’t been able to come up with any conclusions.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Among other duties at UCSF, Dr. Fung also directs the Electrocardiography (EKG) Laboratory, which records the electrical activity of the heart through electrodes placed on the skin. Of the approximately 80,000 EKGs conducted at UCSF Medical Center each year, Dr. Fung personally reads and interprets about 55,000 of these. He also reads echocardiograms, and provides electronic consultation to primary care physicians on cardiology&#45;related issues through the UCSF eConsults. In addition, he volunteers with the American Medical Association, California Medical Association, San Francisco Medical Society, American College of Physicians, American College of Cardiology, and the American Heart Association working on issues including health policy and population health.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Outside of medicine, Dr. Fung is an avid musician, and studied the Chinese violin and classical organ as a youth. He is the founding director of a musical theater group which brings performances to elementary schools, seniors and recovering substance abusers. Each year, he composes four songs on the theme of friendship for that year’s show, and the cast and crew has grown to include about 80 volunteers. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Fung is married to Peggy Fung, a former high school teacher and Kaiser Permanente administrator. Together they have three grown children: Jana Fung, a marketing director; Everett Fung, a financial analyst; and Dr. Kelly Fung, who is continuing the family tradition of medicine and is an internist at Kaiser.

			&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/ucsfhealthcardiology.ucsf.edu/files/images/gerstenfeld2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;imgLeft&quot; style=&quot;margin&#45;top:10px;&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Dr. Edward P. Gerstenfeld, who was appointed as chief of the Cardiac Electrophysiology and Arrhythmia Service at UCSF Medical Center in 2011, combines backgrounds in both medicine and engineering to develop better treatments for heart rhythm problems.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gerstenfeld, who holds the Melvin M. Scheinman Endowed Chair in Cardiology, was born and raised in Staten Island in New York, and studied biomedical and electrical engineering at Duke University in Durham, NC. While working on his master’s degree in biomedical engineering at Northwestern University in Evanston, IL, he worked with electrophysiologists – heart rhythm doctors – to investigate electrical signals of a particular heart problem.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“The combination of working with electrophysiologists, and spending late nights in the lab looking at a lot of chaotic signals, made me think about doing more than just the research side of things,” said Dr. Gerstenfeld. He had considered medicine in the past, but his master’s project helped him realize he could conduct research and also learn what needed to be improved from a patient perspective by becoming a doctor. He was accepted by Northwestern’s medical school and earned his medical degree there, then did his internship and residency at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston, followed by a cardiology fellowship and chief cardiology fellowship at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center in Worcester, MA.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gerstenfeld did part of his electrophysiology fellowship at UCSF, training with former Division of Cardiology faculty member Dr. Michael Lesh, then completed his fellowship at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. He served on the Penn faculty for 10 years before his recruitment to UCSF this year.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;He has published more than 100 peer&#45;reviewed manuscripts, review papers and book chapters on the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. Dr. Gerstenfeld serves on the editorial board of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, Heart Rhythm and the Journal of Interventional Cardiac Electrophysiology. He is also a member of the Clinical Cardiac Electrophysiology Board Writing Committee, the group that develops the national exams for electrophysiology fellows.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;(Reverse) Engineering&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“What we do in medicine is sort of the opposite of engineering,” said Dr. Gerstenfeld. “In engineering, you build something, and try to get it to function in a certain way. In medicine, you've got something that is already built, which is the body, and you try to figure out how it works, and how you can tweak it so it works the way you would like it to work when it's not working.… It’s reverse engineering, in a sense.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“I was interested in science and computers and technology,” he said. “This field has a lot of technology involved, in terms of the recording [of heart signals] and electrical systems. And it’s a puzzle to figure out from these electrical signals what’s going on in the heart – and to determine why people have problems, and how we can come up with better ways to fix it.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;As an electrophysiologist, Dr. Gerstenfeld implants devices like pacemakers – which use electrical impulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate and rhythm – and defibrillators, which shock patients’ hearts out of life&#45;threatening irregular heartbeats. He also specializes in performing catheter ablation to treat irregular heart rhythms. This involves burning or freezing heart tissue associated with the arrhythmia to short&#45;circuit the abnormal rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Catheter ablation intrigued him in part because it brought together his academic and research interests. “There was a lot to figure out, in terms of newer treatments and how to treat patients, and was an interesting application of a lot of what I had learned in graduate school,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;He has since become one of the foremost researchers in discovering how to map the electrical signals of the heart, as well as how to successfully ablate many different types of complex arrhythmias. He has also pioneered ways to use electrocardiograms to localize the source of arrhythmias, and his group was the first to demonstrate that ablation for atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter could be performed safely even in patients with artificial heart valves.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gerstenfeld decided to come to UCSF for the opportunity to lead the electrophysiology group here, and to shape the future of the program. He has found it especially satisfying to treat complex patients, some of whom are receiving second or third procedures for challenging problems. “It’s nice when people who have been through a lot of procedures and are still having trouble come from a distance, and we’re able to help them out,” he said. “I’ve seen people from Utah and Reno, where the local heart rhythm people couldn’t take care of the problem – but we’re able to cure them.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gerstenfeld lives in Marin County with his wife, Leslie, and their two young children. He enjoys biking, playing tennis and traveling.&lt;/p&gt;
			 
			&lt;h3 style=&quot;background:#D9E7F2;padding:5px 10px;&quot;&gt;Melvin M. Scheinman Endowed Chair in Cardiology&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Edward Gerstenfeld is the most recent faculty member to hold the Melvin M. Scheinman Endowed Chair in Cardiology, named for one of the founding fathers of the field of cardiac electrophysiology. This endowed chair was established in 2000 by Dan and Zoe Scheinman, the son and daughter&#45;in&#45;law of Dr. Scheinman, and is held by the chief of the Cardiac Electrophysiology and Arrhythmia Service at UCSF Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“We are tremendously excited to welcome Dr. Gerstenfeld to UCSF,” said Dr. Jeffrey Olgin, chief of the Division of Cardiology and the holder of the Gallo&#45;Chatterjee Distinguished Professorship of Medicine. “It is very fitting that Dr. Gerstenfeld, who is both an outstanding clinician and researcher, holds an endowed chair named for Dr. Scheinman, who is one of the founding pioneers of this field.” Dr. Scheinman performed the first catheter ablation in humans, after conducting extensive studies in animals, and is well known for many other innovations.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“The Melvin M. Scheinman Endowed Chair was instrumental in recruiting an electrophysiologist of Dr. Gerstenfeld’s caliber to UCSF,” said Dr. Olgin. “We are deeply grateful to Dan and Zoe Scheinman for establishing this lasting tribute to Dr. Scheinman, which will continue to promote excellence and innovation in electrophysiology at UCSF.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Cigarette smoking causes about 500,000 deaths in the US each year, making tobacco the leading preventable cause of mortality, including from heart disease. &lt;a href=&quot;https://tobacco.ucsf.edu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at UCSF&lt;/a&gt; is a world leader in reducing this deadly toll, and is led by Dr. Stanton Glantz, Truth Initiative Distinguished Professor of Tobacco Control and a Division of Cardiology faculty member.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The Center recently celebrated its 15th anniversary, and today includes more than 50 faculty from a wide range of disciplines, an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;online archive&lt;/a&gt; of 14 million tobacco industry documents, and a premier training program for future leaders in tobacco control.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Dangers of E&#45;Cigarettes&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;One of the latest areas of investigation has been e&#45;cigarettes, which are unregulated by the US Food and Drug Administration and have been marketed as a safer alternative to cigarettes, as well as a way to help smokers quit.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Glantz and his colleagues recently published some of the first papers demonstrating that e&#45;cigarette smokers are actually less likely to quit smoking. “The original idea was that smokers would switch to e&#45;cigarettes, but we’ve found they are actually becoming ‘dual users,’ smoking both cigarettes and e&#45;cigarettes,” said Dr. Glantz. “The overall evidence is that smokers who use e&#45;cigarettes are less likely to quit by about 25 to 30 percent than smokers who don’t use e&#45;cigarettes. We think one way that happens is that you can use e&#45;cigarettes in a lot of places where you can’t smoke [conventional cigarettes].&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Although e&#45;cigarettes emit fewer toxic chemicals than cigarettes, scientists still don’t know the full effects of “vaping” on health. “Just because e&#45;cigarettes are less dangerous than cigarettes doesn’t make them safe,” said Dr. Glantz. Many people are unaware that cigarettes actually cause more cardiovascular deaths than lung cancer deaths. This happens because cigarette smoke can trigger a complex series of events making blood clots more likely to form and impairing blood vessels’ ability to carry increased blood flow when needed. More research is needed to understand whether e&#45;cigarettes have similar effects on the cardiovascular system, but the ultrafine particles that both cigarettes and e&#45;cigarettes produce is one of the likely causes.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;E&#45;cigarettes have been aggressively marketed to youth through television and radio ad campaigns, as well as design aspects such as fruit flavors that are more likely to appeal to children. Because e&#45;cigarettes are not regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration, they are not subject to the advertising restrictions on cigarettes. Dr. Glantz and his colleagues were among the first to publish research showing that minors who initiate nicotine use with e&#45;cigarettes are more likely to become smokers, and are also less likely to quit.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Deception Uncovered&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Glantz earned a doctorate in applied mechanics and engineering from Stanford University, and his early research as a UCSF faculty member focused on the mechanical interactions between the chambers of the heart. His interest in the health impacts of cigarettes was a hobby, sparked in part by a request to serve as an expert witness for seemingly healthy, thin, non&#45;smoking waiter who worked in a smoky restaurant. The waiter filed a worker’s compensation claim after he had a heart attack, suspecting it was caused by the restaurant’s secondhand smoke. “I started digging into the literature, and that’s what got me interested in smoking and heart disease,” recalled Dr. Glantz. He and Dr. William Parmley, former chief of the Division of Cardiology, began conducting lab research on that topic.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;A few years later, in 1994, Dr. Glantz received a box containing secret documents from the Brown &amp; Williamson tobacco company. The whistleblower’s return address was listed as “Mr. Butts,” the cigarette&#45;shaped Doonesbury cartoon character. Dr. Glantz and his colleagues sorted through 4,000 pages documenting that Big Tobacco lied to the public while knowing cigarettes were addictive and harmful. “The documents show industry executives saying things like, ‘We’re in the business of selling nicotine, an addictive drug,’ in 1963,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Glantz and his team published &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7609230&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;five groundbreaking papers&lt;/a&gt; based on the documents in the Journal of the American Medical Association and published the source documents online – the origins of today’s vast online archive, which is freely available to the world. This evidence helped fuel litigation against the four largest US cigarette manufacturers, resulting in the Master Settlement Agreement that, among other provisions, restricted advertising, required tobacco companies to pay more than $200 billion to compensate the states for the cost of treating tobacco&#45;related disease, and made the millions of pages of internal tobacco industry documents publicly available that are now on the Internet at UCSF.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;h3&gt;On the Vanguard&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Two of Dr. Glantz’s current projects include:&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://smokefreemovies.ucsf.edu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; alt=&quot;smoke free movies&quot;&gt;Smoke&#45;free movies&lt;/a&gt;: The US tobacco industry has a long, documented history of collaborating with the film industry to promote youth smoking by portraying it as cool and attractive. The US Surgeon General has estimated that giving an R rating to movies with smoking would significantly reduce the youth smoking rate, based partly on studies published by Dr. Glantz and his team.
			
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Marijuana policy: Dr. Glantz and his colleagues recently published &lt;a href=&quot;https://tobacco.ucsf.edu/legalized&#45;marijuana&#45;california&#45;could&#45;hurt&#45;public&#45;health&#45;analysis&#45;says&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;an analysis of two proposed California ballot initiatives&lt;/a&gt; which would legalize marijuana. “The initiatives are written primarily to create a new business and only include minimal protections for public health,” said Dr. Glantz. “We’re saying, we should legalize it so we stop throwing people in jail, but do it in a way to actively discourage its use – using the same kinds of product regulation, labeling, taxation and clean indoor air laws that we know work for tobacco [control].”
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Glantz is also proud of the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education’s fellowship program, which has trained more than 60 scholars since 2001. The fellows come from a broad range of disciplines, including medicine, public health, biochemistry, epidemiology, psychology, law, anthropology, economics, history and communications.
			
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One thing that has made me effective is being conversant in biology, epidemiology and policy,” said Dr. Glantz. He encourages trainees to learn from each other’s diverse backgrounds and explain jargon, whether it’s a doctor describing endothelial function or an economist describing the basics of price elasticity. 
			
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program draws trainees from all over the world who have gone on to lead tobacco control and education efforts in their home countries. In recognition of tobacco’s global reach, the program trains international as well as domestic fellows, including:&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tobacco.ucsf.edu/users/cathyegbe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dr. Catherine O. Egbe&lt;/a&gt;, a psychologist and current fellow, studies the tobacco industry’s influence on tobacco control policies in Nigeria.
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tobacco.ucsf.edu/sites/tobacco.ucsf.edu/files/Newsletter%20Vol.%201%20%28No.%205%29.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dr. Quan Gan&lt;/a&gt;, a public health specialist in China, works at a non&#45;governmental organization which has collaborated with the Chinese government to pass indoor smoke&#45;free laws in Beijing and Shanghai.
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick&#45;schneider&#45;05b1b1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dr. Nick Schneider&lt;/a&gt;, a physician in the German Ministry of Health, chaired the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control’s working group on developing guidelines for education, communication, training and public awareness.
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“When I first came to UCSF, most people thought it was nuts to bring a non&#45;physician PhD engineer into a Division of Cardiology,” said Dr. Glantz. “But hanging out with clinicians like Tom Ports, Nelson Schiller and Elias Botvinick and listening to the problems they were having led me to a whole different career than if I had been in an engineering or physiology department. I think that’s what the university is for – a place where you’re pushing boundaries and can pursue things that everyone else thinks is crazy.”&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;&quot;I always love to hear my patients' life stories,&quot; said cardiologist Dr. Donald Grandis, who recently joined the UCSF faculty. &quot;If you're in clinical practice for a long time, you not only hear the story – you become a positive part of the story.&quot; He recalled a patient with mitral valve disease who was able to start a family and is now a grandmother. &quot;I was able to become part of the story, because her life decisions depended in part on management of her disease,&quot; he said.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
			Dr. Grandis grew up in Virginia, studied philosophy at the University of Virginia, then served as a Peace Corps tuberculosis control worker in a South Korean fishing village. He vividly remembers a young man who likely had a heart defect that causes bluish skin due to low blood oxygen. &quot;I was very moved and thought, ‘Someday I want to be able to help people like that,'&quot; said Dr. Grandis.
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			He earned his medical degree from Virginia Commonwealth University and completed medicine residency and a cardiology fellowship at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. During medical school, he observed a cardiology patient who was so sick he was unable to lie flat on the procedure table. &quot;I asked a nurse what would happen, and she said, ‘If he doesn't get a transplant, he'll probably die,'&quot; said Dr. Grandis. &quot;That was thirty years ago. What's so rewarding about cardiology is that our current treatments are so powerful and effective that you wouldn't make the same prediction today.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;Tailoring Care&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
			Dr. Grandis loved clinical medicine and wanted to treat a wide variety of cardiac conditions. He established a private practice in 1994, which he ran for 20 years with several partners. He also helped establish a cardiology program at Jefferson Regional Medical Center, a community hospital in Jefferson Hills, PA. In addition to general cardiology, he performed angioplasties, interventional medicine, nuclear medicine and echocardiograms.
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			&quot;One of the most enjoyable aspects of practicing clinical medicine is tailoring research findings and personal experience to fit the nuances of each patient,&quot; said Dr. Grandis. &quot;There's never just one formula that can be used for every patient. To offer the most appropriate care for the individual patient requires a thoughtful physician who listens. It's always interesting and challenging.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			His practice was based in a part of Pittsburgh nicknamed &quot;Steel Valley,&quot; which had some of the nation's worst air pollution. Dr. Grandis successfully worked with local organizations and the Allegheny Health Department to advocate for enforcement of air quality standards. &quot;About 20 percent of people who have a heart attack don't necessarily have all of the typical risk factors like high cholesterol,&quot; he said. &quot;We're always looking for other potential causes, including poor air quality. Many places around the world are developing rapidly, which is associated with more air pollution, so it's an international health problem.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Dr. Grandis is excited to join the UCSF faculty, and will mainly work with the Center for Prevention of Heart and Vascular Disease, in addition to caring for hospitalized patients and helping to interpret echocardiograms and nuclear studies. &quot;The level of thoughtfulness and innovation at UCSF is unparalleled, and I feel lucky to have such great colleagues,&quot; he said.
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			He is also looking forward to integrating his previous experience with the care he provides here. &quot;In private practice, basically the patient is your boss,&quot; he said. &quot;I've spent a lot of time thinking about what gives patients a better experience and increases their satisfaction.&quot; For example, he makes an effort to &quot;close the loop&quot; by talking to a patient's primary care physician, surgeon and sub&#45;subspecialists. He tells the patient what the providers' consensus is and asks if the patient has questions. &quot;It's easy to get lost in the health system, so knowing that somebody is keeping an eye out for them makes patients feel confident,&quot; said Dr. Grandis.
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			In addition to a passion for clinical care, Dr. Grandis enjoys sailing, biking and skiing. He is married to Dr. Jennifer Grandis, who was recently recruited as UCSF's associate vice chancellor of Clinical and Translational Research and who is a professor of Otolaryngology &amp;mdash; Head and Neck Surgery.

			&lt;h2&gt;On the Hunt for Abnormal Rhythms&lt;/h2&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/ucsfhealthcardiology.ucsf.edu/files/images/hsia2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;imgLeft&quot;/&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot; style=&quot;padding:0;&quot;&gt;
			Like a skilled hunter tracking elusive prey, cardiac electrophysiologist Dr. Henry Hsia is an expert at interpreting subtle signals that indicate where his quarry lies.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In his case, Dr. Hsia (pronounced &quot;Shaw&quot;) is hunting the source of abnormal heart rhythms, also known as cardiac arrhythmias. He specializes in treating ventricular tachycardia (VT), a potentially life&#45;threatening condition in which the lower chambers of the heart beat very rapidly – up to 250 beats per minute – due to problems with heart’s electrical system. Dr. Hsia is chief of the Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology Service at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center (SFVAMC), and also sees patients and performs procedures at the Parnassus campus one day a week.
			
			&lt;p&gt;In a normal heart, the body’s natural pacemaker sends out an electrical signal that initiates each heartbeat. This signal flows smoothly through the heart, causing first the upper chambers (atria) and then the lower chambers (ventricles) to contract and squeeze blood. One of the most common causes of VT is scar tissue from a heart attack. Because it does not conduct electricity well, scar tissue can interrupt the smooth flow of electrical currents through the heart.
			
			&lt;p&gt;In addition to prescribing medications to control the arrhythmia and implanting a defibrillator to shock the heart out of VT, electrophysiologists can also perform an ablation – strategically burning small areas of heart tissue which are the source of VTs.
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;In general, the scar is not completely dead,&quot; said Dr. Hsia. &quot;With ablation, we try to find channels of the few remaining viable cells within that scar and burn out the last remnant of fibers that are causing electrical problems.&quot;
			
			Pinpointing the Cause
			
			&lt;p&gt;VT was previously treated through open heart surgery, in which surgeons could see the scar and cut it out. Although the procedure was effective, it was quite invasive and carried a high risk of mortality. Today, VT can be treated by catheter ablation, in which an electrophysiologist inserts a catheter into the heart, records electrical signals to identify the troublesome area, then uses electrical energy to destroy the problematic tissue.
			
			&lt;p&gt;VT ablation presents special challenges. For most types of arrhythmias, electrophysiologists try to induce the abnormal rhythm, then &quot;map&quot; the abnormal electrical activity throughout the heart to pinpoint the source of the problem. However, inducing VT for more than a few seconds can be life&#45;threatening. Also, these patients are usually quite frail and have a weak heart muscle, and are even less able to tolerate prolonged arrhythmia episodes.
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;With VT patients, the traditional mapping techniques often do not work due to patient intolerance, so we have to find surrogate markers that help us to focus on where the problem really is – without inducing the abnormal rhythm,&quot; said Dr. Hsia. &quot;Instead of going after the VT itself, we try to go after the scar that produces the VT…. We always tell the fellows [electrophysiology trainees] that 40 percent of an ablation is done before the procedure. These procedures are long and complicated, and the patient is frequently not stable, so you have to have a detailed game plan before you go in.&quot;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Formulating that plan requires Dr. Hsia to integrate information from a number of tools, zeroing in on the electrical source of a patient’s VT. He is like a hunter piecing together the trail of a wily animal – perhaps detecting paw prints and a faint trail through a meadow – while rarely catching a glimpse of the animal itself.
			
			&lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the best imaging technique for viewing scars and the soft tissue of the heart. Another imaging tool is intracardiac ultrasound, which can sometimes enable electrophysiologists to see scarring within the heart. Electrocardiograms (EKGs) can also provide a general indication of where the problem might lie. For patients with a defibrillator, Dr. Hsia combs through their device records, looking for clues about which part of the heart was affected during a VT episode.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Hsia is a leader in developing new methods to pinpoint the source of VTs. His research has included advances in characterizing the scar and identifying potential locations of arrhythmias. &quot;Using various electrical maneuvers, we try to bring out different subtleties within the scar without inducing the abnormal rhythm,&quot; said Dr. Hsia. &quot;We look for voltage differences, since scar tissue has lower voltage than non&#45;scar tissue.&quot; In addition, if the electrical impulse appears to be delayed in one part of the heart, it could provide another clue. &quot;If you detect that the electrical conduction through this area is delayed, there may be a diseased scar there,&quot; said Dr. Hsia.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p&gt;By putting together all these pieces of information, Dr. Hsia formulates a good estimate of where the arrhythmia originates – like narrowing his prey’s location from a whole forest to a specific cluster of trees. &quot;Ideally, you map everything out and identify all the potential targets, but ultimately you still have to confirm where the problem is,&quot; he said. He will then try to induce the VT for a short time to make sure that he is at the right spot. &quot;If you can map the rhythm while it’s going on, that’s the most accurate way,&quot; he said. He can often stop the induced arrhythmia by pacing the heart back into a normal rhythm, rather than needing to shock it.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p&gt;Once he has the most accurate idea possible of the source of the VT, Dr. Hsia performs the actual ablation – the equivalent of shooting a gun at the target. He uses catheter&#45;based devices to deliver radiofrequency energy, burning the problematic area. He then tests the heart to see if the arrhythmia has stopped, and performs further &quot;touch&#45;up&quot; ablations if needed. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Improving Quality of Life&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;If it’s done properly, VT ablation can significantly reduce the rhythm recurrence in about 80 percent of patients, but it’s not going to be a ‘cure’,&quot; said Dr. Hsia. &quot;They might have a VT episode every six months, but now maybe their defibrillator can pace them out of it – it doesn’t have to shock them out of it – and the patient doesn’t even know he or she had the episode.&quot; Patients who have successfully undergone an ablation may also be able to discontinue taking anti&#45;arrhythmic drugs, which can produce significant side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p&gt;The results can greatly improve quality of life. Dr. Hsia recalled one VT patient who received 300 shocks from his defibrillator in one year. &quot;It’s horrible – patients like that know they are dying because of their rhythm problems,&quot; he said. &quot;They feel dizzy and may pass out. They get shocked by their defibrillator, and then five minutes later it happens again.&quot; After receiving two ablations, the patient improved dramatically and was able to return to his regular life. &quot;I saw him walking around a few years later, and I actually didn’t recognize him because I’d always seen him lying flat,&quot; said Dr. Hsia.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Treating Other Forms of VT&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Although many instances of VT are caused by scarring from a heart attack, there are rarer forms that often require different approaches. For example, heart attacks usually produce a discrete mass of scar tissue within the heart; by contrast, chemotherapy, radiation and viral infections can produce more diffuse scarring throughout the heart, including on the outside surface of the heart. If the scar that is producing the VT is on the outside of the heart, the patient will often require an epicardial ablation. This involves making a puncture just below the breastbone and carefully inserting a long needle through the thin sac that surrounds the heart to ablate part of the epicardium – the outer surface of the heart. This delicate procedure requires a high level of technical skill.
			
			&lt;p&gt;Another type of ventricular arrhythmia is called idiopathic or normal heart ventricular arrhythmia. Often these patients are quite young, and their VT is caused not by scar tissue but by abnormal cells, often around their heart valves. The good news is that these patients often respond very well to ablation. &quot;Usually you can find the focal area, without scar, and you can zap it and actually cure it,&quot; said Dr. Hsia.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Continuing a Tradition of Excellence&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Hsia grew up in Taiwan, in a family of engineers, and earned his bachelor’s degree and medical degree at Tufts University in Boston. He completed his residency at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, his cardiology fellowship at the University of Texas Southwestern in Dallas, and his electrophysiology fellowship at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. &quot;I wanted to do something with my hands, and found that electrophysiology was one of the most fascinating and intellectual fields in cardiology,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p&gt;He served on the cardiology faculty at Temple University in Philadelphia, then at the University of Pennsylvania. From 2005 until his recruitment to UCSF, Dr. Hsia served on the Stanford faculty and also directed the electrophysiology laboratory at the Palo Alto VA. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p&gt;He was drawn to UCSF by its historic accomplishments – Dr. Melvin Scheinman, the Walter H. Shorenstein Endowed Chair in Cardiology, was the first person to perform catheter ablation in humans – as well as its current faculty. &quot;The UCSF electrophysiology group has a great tradition, and this is a very collegial and academic environment,&quot; said Dr. Hsia.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p&gt;He brings his deep experience in VT ablation to the SFVAMC, where he is currently the only electrophysiologist who can offer this procedure. (In addition to Dr. Hsia, several of the cardiology faculty members based at UCSF Medical Center have expertise in VT ablations.)&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;Dr. Hsia has established a reputation as one of the most experienced ablationists of ventricular tachycardia on the West Coast,&quot; said Dr. Edward P. Gerstenfeld, chief of the Cardiac Electrophysiology and Arrhythmia Service at UCSF Medical Center and the Melvin M. Scheinman Endowed Chair in Cardiology. &quot;We were fortunate to recruit him from Stanford to UCSF, and his arrival further establishes UCSF as the premier center for complex VT ablations in Northern California.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Improving Patient Care&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Hsia hopes to make this procedure more widely available to those who need it. For example, he wants to employ telemedicine to make arrhythmia consultations more easily available to veterans throughout the Pacific region. Because the VA electronic medical record system is so robust, it could allow him to offer initial evaluations through secure video conferencing to patients as far away as Guam, as well as areas in the U.S. without easy access to specialists like him. Telemedicine could help improve access to underserved populations.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;VT ablation is something that only some academic centers and only a very few VAs provide,&quot; he said. &quot;If you live in a place like Eureka, the local docs there probably don’t know that such a service is available.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Hsia is also active in clinical research. In addition to his own pioneering work in the electrophysiology lab, he participates in clinical trials such as the ASPIRE study, which is evaluating whether providing ablation to patients with recurrent VT earlier rather than later in the course of their disease is more beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p&gt;In his spare time, he has become a certified diving medical officer, learning about many physiological diving&#45;related problems. He is an avid scuba diver and underwater photographer, and also enjoys land&#45;based hobbies such as concerts and fine dining in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h2&gt;Creating Connections with Patients&lt;/h2&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/ucsfhealthcardiology.ucsf.edu/files/images/janmohamed.jpg&quot; class=&quot;imgLeft&quot;/&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot; style=&quot;padding:0;&quot;&gt;
			The pocket of Dr. Munir Janmohamed’s white coat is just large enough to hold his iPad, which he frequently uses to show patients videos of heart failure devices and the latest heart pumps.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s important to spend that extra time to communicate with your patients,&quot; said Dr. Janmohamed, an advanced heart failure and transplant cardiologist. &quot;Heart failure can be a terrifying disease.  So instead of using medical jargon, I strive to answer their questions in a simple way, and use videos and pictures as much as possible to help them understand what is going on with them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;He knows what it’s like to be on the other side of these encounters, since his mother was treated for cancer at UCSF. &quot;We met some great people here who did a wonderful job of communicating with my mother and our family,&quot; he said. &quot;I won’t ever forget that. So when I see my patients, I try to put them at ease by making sure they’re informed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Inspired to become a doctor by observing his father, a primary care physician in Sacramento, Dr. Janmohamed earned a bachelor’s degree in biology from UC Irvine, then graduated from Ross University School of Medicine in the West Indies. He completed his residency at Louisiana State University – University Medical Center in Lafayette, LA, followed by fellowships in nuclear medicine fellowship at the University of Southern California, cardiovascular medicine at UCSF Fresno, and advanced heart failure and transplantation at UCSF, where he trained with Dr. Teresa De Marco.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;As a heart failure cardiologist, I’m really able to take patients from the beginning of their disease all the way through to advanced medical therapies, such as pumps called LVADs [left ventricular assist devices] or until they receive a new heart with a transplant,&quot; said Dr. Janmohamed. &quot;Then, with their new heart, we can work on areas of cardiology such as primary prevention and help them to manage medications to prevent rejection of their new heart.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Bringing Care to More Patients&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;His training at UCSF Fresno has helped him to understand the challenges facing populations outside urban settings. Now, in addition to providing care in the hospital and clinic, Dr. Janmohamed is pioneering satellite facilities outside of San Francisco which will bring advanced heart failure care to small communities. The purpose of these clinics is to conduct assessment of potential candidates for advanced heart failure therapies in order to identify more patients who may benefit from these life&#45;saving treatments. (UCSF has already successfully established such outreach clinics for kidney and liver transplantation in cities such as Fresno, offering patients ease of access and convenience within their local communities and facilitating the intake process.)&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;Advanced therapies used to be reserved only for heart failure patients who were dying, and we realized that often we were seeing patients when it was too late,&quot; said Dr. Janmohamed. &quot;The key is having a heart failure cardiologist involved early on, when patients don’t have a lot of kidney or liver problems that might preclude them from receiving these advanced therapies.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;These treatments, offered to appropriate patients at the right time, can dramatically improve both survival as well as quality of life. Patients who experienced constant fatigue and shortness of breath can often return to work and daily activities. Also, while the number of heart transplants will always be constrained by the shortage of donor organs, LVADs can be offered to many more patients as a result of such outreach programs. Dr. Janmohamed is training local cardiologists to co&#45;manage patients who have received LVADs and transplants, so patients can receive routine follow&#45;up care closer to home. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In addition to clinical care, Dr. Janmohamed is conducting academic research in pulmonary hypertension – a complex disorder involving high blood pressure in the arteries to the lungs. &quot;This is a condition that more commonly affects young women, and has a high mortality rate,&quot; said Dr. Janmohamed. &quot;Yet in the last 10 years, there has been a marked increase in the number of therapies we are able to offer.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;As a physician, he feels privileged to get to know his patients as whole people. &quot;I really enjoy establishing close connections with my patients, and that’s what I love most about medicine,&quot; he said. In his spare time, Dr. Janmohamed enjoys traveling internationally, cheering on the 49ers and savoring San Francisco’s cuisine with good friends.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Dr. Liviu Klein was born in Braşov, a city in Romania about 16 miles from Dracula’s Castle.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“As a transplant cardiologist, I frequently do biopsies,” he said, referring to a procedure that involves inserting a catheter into a vein in the neck and threading it into the heart, where a small scissor&#45;like device removes tiny tissue samples. “I always tell patients, ‘I can get your jugular without any problems,’” said Dr. Klein. “Everybody laughs about that.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Klein was recruited from Northwestern University in 2011. At UCSF, he cares for hospitalized patients as an attending physician on the Advanced Heart Failure and Transplant Service, sees heart failure patients in clinic at both Mission Bay and Parnassus, and serves as associate director of the Mechanical Circulatory Support and Heart Failure Programs. He also conducts innovative research about women and heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The son of two engineers, Dr. Klein attended a high school focused on math and computers before attending medical school in Bucharest. Although he chose to become a doctor, his rigorous training in information technology has helped shape his career.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;He moved to Chicago for his internship and residency at Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center, and developed a passion for treating patients with heart failure – a condition in which the heart is unable to pump enough blood to the rest of the body – in part because it requires treating many different problems in cardiology simultaneously. “One drug that can help this pathway can hurt that pathway,” he said. “You really have to master the physiology and pharmacology, and integrate everything.” &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Klein earned his master’s degree in clinical investigation at Northwestern University, where he also completed fellowships in cardiovascular epidemiology, cardiovascular disease, and advanced heart failure and transplantation. Because so many of his heart failure patients also suffered from arrhythmias – problems with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat – he also completed another fellowship in clinical cardiac electrophysiology at Northwestern.&lt;/p&gt;
			 
			&lt;p&gt;When he joined the faculty at Northwestern, he used his breadth of knowledge to establish a combined heart failure and electrophysiology clinic. “It was ‘one&#45;stop shopping,’” said Dr. Klein. “Patients really liked seeing one doctor who could fix all their problems.” He also applied his expertise in computers to cardiology, setting up a remote monitoring heart failure program for patients with implantable devices such as pacemakers and defibrillators. By analyzing data uploaded from the devices and calling them when the computer detected abnormalities – often before the patient experienced any noticeable symptoms – his team was able to decrease hospitalizations by almost 50 percent among enrolled patients.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Women and Heart Failure&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;As a resident, Dr. Klein cared for a hospitalized female patient who was unresponsive to standard therapies, which were developed in studies primarily focusing on men. When he tailored her medications to her particular symptoms, she started to improve. “That’s when I started to realize there was something different between heart failure in men and women,” said Dr. Klein. “For all these years, the clinical trials have enrolled about 80 percent men, yet if you look at the registry data, about half of heart failure patients are women.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Klein analyzed data from the Women’s Health Initiative Hormone Therapy trial, a 15&#45;year national study involving 27,000 postmenopausal women. He and his colleagues helped develop better methods for diagnosing heart failure in women, and also found that hormone replacement therapy did not protect women against developing heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;His current research interest is the pharmacogenomics of heart failure therapy in women – determining whether genetic differences predispose some groups to respond differently to hormone therapy, and whether those responses are associated with different rates of heart failure and sudden cardiac death. Future findings could help physicians customize combinations and dosages of medications for each patient, maximizing benefits while reducing side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“Heart failure patients often take between six and 10 medications – they literally carry a pharmacy with them,” said Dr. Klein. “My dream for the immediate future is to have a trial that randomizes patients based on their genetic makeup to different drugs. … Eventually, we may have enough data to say, based on your genetic subtype, you’re not going to respond to medication A and B – you just need medication C.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Klein is married to UCSF hospitalist Dr. Oana Klein. Together they are proud parents of 20&#45;month&#45;old twin girls, Iris and Hanna.&lt;/p&gt;

Faculty Spotlight: Dr. Byron Lee ./cardiology/facstaff/spotlight/lee.html

		<FileBody>
			
			&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/ucsfhealthcardiology.ucsf.edu/files/images/lee.jpg&quot; class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Photo credit: Elizabeth Fall&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;One of Dr. Byron Lee’s greatest joys is taking care of patients he has known since childhood – friends of his mother, the shopkeeper at the corner store, his youth group leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;I know where they’re coming from, and can address some of their concerns and anxieties,&quot; said Dr. Lee, who grew up in San Francisco’s Chinatown and North Beach neighborhoods and now holds the Samuel T. and Elizabeth Webb Reeves Endowed Chair in Arrhythmia Research. As an electrophysiologist, he treats abnormal heart rhythms called cardiac arrhythmias, which can often be managed or even cured when a patient receives a device like a pacemaker, or undergoes an ablation procedure to treat the underlying cause of the arrhythmia.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;A lot of patients I see need a procedure or device, but are reluctant to do this because they knew people who had an operation or procedure – maybe back in China – and didn’t make it,&quot; said Dr. Lee. &quot;I spend extra time reassuring them that the procedures we do are safe, and could really help improve their quality of life.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;For patients who decide to have a needed procedure, the results can be life&#45;changing. &quot;We sometimes get patients who have had heart palpitations throughout their life, and they’ve always been told that their problem is anxiety,&quot; said Dr. Lee. &quot;Patients think they have a personal weakness. Part of the problem was that every time they went to see the doctor, they were not in the arrhythmia. The doctors might say, ‘You’re just too nervous – calm down.’ They sometimes even referred them to a psychiatrist, who might put them on anti&#45;anxiety medicines. When we diagnose patients with an arrhythmia and can cure it, they describe how their life has been totally transformed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lee grew up learning Cantonese and a dialect called Toisan from his parents and grandparents. Although he sometimes uses an interpreter in clinic, his language skills come in handy during procedures, when no interpreter is present. &quot;I can say, ‘Are you feeling okay? There is nothing to worry about – everything is going fine,’&quot; said Dr. Lee. &quot;I feel lucky that I know enough Chinese to be reassuring.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Preventing Sudden Death&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lee earned his bachelor’s degree from UC Berkeley, then graduated from Harvard Medical School before completing his internal medicine residency and fellowships in cardiology and cardiac electrophysiology from Stanford University Medical Center. When a faculty position at UCSF opened up in 2002, he jumped at the chance. &quot;It was a dream come true to do academic electrophysiology and to take care of the community I grew up in,&quot; he said. &quot;I was ecstatic!&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Dr. Lee serves as director of the Electrophysiology Laboratory and co&#45;medical director of the UCSF Heart and Vascular Clinic. He is also a clinical researcher, serving as co&#45;principal investigator – along with Dr. Jeffrey Olgin, chief of the Division of Cardiology and Gallo&#45;Chatterjee Distinguished Professor of Medicine, and internist and epidemiologist Dr. Mark Pletcher – of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://vestpredicts.ucsf.edu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Vest prevention of Early Sudden death Trial&lt;/a&gt; (VEST), an international, multi&#45;center study. It is investigating whether a wearable cardiac defibrillator can help prevent sudden cardiac death among patients who have had a heart attack in the past three months and are at elevated risk of developing a life&#45;threatening arrhythmia.
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			After a heart attack, scar tissue forms in the heart which can contribute to irregular electrical currents and cause arrhythmias. The vest is worn under the clothes and continuously monitors the heart; if it detects a life&#45;threatening arrhythmia, the vest delivers an electric shock that can reset the heart rhythm.
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			&quot;No one currently knows what the best strategy is for preventing sudden cardiac death in these patients,&quot; said Dr. Lee. Other studies have tried placing implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) in patients shortly after a heart attack, but there has been no mortality benefit – perhaps because there might be something inherently dangerous in implanting the device in patients so soon after a heart attack. &quot;Our hypothesis is that there might be some benefit to this at&#45;risk population by using this wearable vest that doesn’t require surgery,&quot; he said. The study will enroll 2,300 patients, and he expects results to be available at the end of 2017.
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Dr. Lee has also conducted research related to TASERs, the electrical stun guns used by many law enforcement agencies. &quot;Most sudden deaths are related to arrhythmia, so we were trying to figure out whether TASERs could trigger an arrhythmia,&quot; said Dr. Lee. &quot;There were news reports of people who had been TASERed during their arrest, and soon after are found dead.&quot; He and his colleagues surveyed California police and sheriff departments, using the Public Records Act and Freedom of Information Act, and found that departments that began using TASERs experienced a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ajconline.org/article/S0002&#45;9149(08)02113&#45;9/abstract&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;substantial increase in in&#45;custody sudden deaths during the first year of their use&lt;/a&gt;, with no decrease in firearm deaths or officer injuries.
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Dr. Lee and his colleagues also noticed that many TASER&#45;related studies were funded by TASER International, the device’s manufacturer, or affiliated authors. By reviewing 50 studies in the literature, they found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21884872&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;studies that were funded by TASER or an affiliated author were 18 times more likely to conclude that TASERs were safe&lt;/a&gt;, compared with independently funded studies. &quot;A lot of people tout the pro&#45;Taser research and say, ‘This is why we should have TASERs in our city, because it’s safe,&quot; said Dr. Lee. &quot;But they need to be reminded that most of this research is funded by the company that makes the TASER, so you need to be cautious. From my research and other people’s, too, it’s clear that the TASER is not a perfectly safe tool. If the TASER electrodes are close enough to the heart, they can cause it to beat rapidly and dangerously.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Mentoring the Next Generation&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In addition to his research and clinical work, Dr. Lee enjoys his role as an educator. He teaches a course to medical students on electrocardiogram interpretation, encouraging them to pay attention to detail and small deviations from normal. He also relishes the opportunity to teach residents and fellows on the job. &quot;More than anything else, what keeps me in academics is the joy of teaching young doctors and helping them become better clinicians,&quot; he said. &quot;One of my proudest moments is seeing former students doing something great, and feeling that I was perhaps a small sliver of helping them achieve that.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			He has mentored many aspiring doctors and trainees, including a number from underrepresented backgrounds who may be the first to attend college, let alone medical school. He uses much of the support he receives from the Samuel T. and Elizabeth Webb Reeves Endowed Chair in Arrhythmia Research to help medical students, residents, fellows and even pre&#45;medical students gain research experience.
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			&quot;The research experience that people gain can help them get to the next step, whether it’s medical school, residency or their first job,&quot; said Dr. Lee. &quot;I know what it’s like – I remember begging for a research job so I could get into medical school, and it’s my duty to pay it back. And you never know if you may be inspiring the next Nobel Prize winner.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Dr. Lee has served on the medical school admissions committees at Harvard Medical School and UCSF, and developed a keen understanding of what makes a strong candidate. With two others, he co&#45;authored the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Insiders&#45;Pre&#45;Med&#45;Guidebook&#45;admissions&#45;Americas&#45;ebook/dp/B01AX11SY2/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1475879573&amp;sr=8&#45;1&#45;fkmr0&amp;keywords=insider%27s+guide+to+med+school&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Insider's Pre&#45;Med Guidebook: Advice from Admissions Faculty at America’s Top Medical Schools&lt;/a&gt;. He has also individually coached more than 50 medical school applicants, helping them identify and present their greatest talents in their application essays and interviews.
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			&quot;Many of these kids come from underprivileged families, and may not have family members or friends who are doctors or professionals that can help them with their essays,&quot; said Dr. Lee. &quot;They have a lot of strengths, but need help learning how to articulate them in ways that resonate with the admissions committees.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			In addition to helping future doctors navigate the admissions process, Dr. Lee’s dream project would be developing a way to help non&#45;English speakers better navigate the health care system. &quot;I worry about my patients who don’t speak English, and wish we had more culturally sensitive clinical delivery systems,&quot; he said. &quot;Interpreters are usually only available to help during the doctor’s appointment. If we also had patient care navigators who spoke other languages and could help patients schedule additional appointments or get to the lab for tests we’ve ordered, it would help optimize care.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Outside of UCSF, Dr. Lee volunteered for many years at CityTeam San Francisco – which offers meals and shelter for the homeless. &quot;Growing up in San Francisco, I saw a lot of homeless people and was always concerned about them,&quot; he said. &quot;As a volunteer doctor at CityTeam, I treated cuts, abrasions, viral syndromes and skin infections – run&#45;of&#45;the&#45;mill things, but people were so thankful, and it meant a lot to them.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			His other major activity outside of work is his family. He is married to Tracy Park, a program director who develops training programs for preschool teachers. Together they have four sons, ages one through nine, and Dr. Lee stays busy coaching basketball, baseball and soccer.

			&lt;img src=&quot;http://profiles.ucsf.edu/profile/Modules/CustomViewPersonGeneralInfo/PhotoHandler.ashx?NodeID=47862740&quot; class=&quot;imgLeft&quot; style=&quot;margin&#45;top:10px;&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;&quot;In the Western world, about 80 percent of all children who are born with a congenital heart condition will become an adult,&quot; said Dr. V.S. Mahadevan, the William W. Parmley Endowed Chair in Cardiology and an expert in caring for adults with heart defects. &quot;But about 50 percent of all adult congenital heart patients will need further intervention or surgery, as well as ongoing care and treatment.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mahadevan (pronounced MAH&#45;ha&#45;day&#45;ven) was recently recruited from the Manchester Royal Infirmary in the United Kingdom, where he pioneered less invasive methods of treating these patients. As an interventional cardiologist, he specializes in using catheter&#45;based procedures, in which devices and instruments are threaded through a blood vessel up into the heart.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;For more than a decade, he has used this technique to replace valves that have become stiff, narrowed or unable to close properly. Although valve replacement has been accomplished through open heart surgery for decades, Dr. Mahadevan is one of the few cardiologists in the world who has used catheter&#45;based approaches to replace valves in all four positions in the heart – the aortic, mitral, pulmonary and tricuspid valves. He also led the team which performed the first&#45;in&#45;human mitral valve replacement using a catheter&#45;based procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;While open heart surgery is still the gold standard for valve replacement, it carries significant risk: a large surgical incision is made in the chest, and the patient’s heart is stopped while he or she is placed on a heart&#45;lung machine during the procedure. By contrast, catheter&#45;based procedures – also known as percutaneous or transcatheter procedures – only require a small cut in the skin to access a major blood vessel. These procedures can usually be done without general anesthesia and often result in shorter hospital stays and faster recovery times.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Percutaneous valve replacement can be a good option for patients who are at high risk for traditional surgical implantation. &quot;Adult congenital heart patients have often already had multiple cardiac surgeries by the age of 25 or 30, which increases the risk for further [surgical] procedures quite significantly,&quot; said Dr. Mahadevan. Most commonly, these patients need replacement of their pulmonary valve – the valve that leads to the pulmonary artery, which carries blood to the lungs to receive oxygen. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;On the other hand, there are very elderly patients without congenital heart disease who need a mitral or aortic valve,&quot; said Dr. Mahadevan. &quot;They may not have had previous cardiac surgeries, but they may have depleted lung function, abnormal kidney function or vascular disease and are at increased risk for surgery, so a transcatheter valve would be preferable.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Replacing Heart Valves&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;To implant a valve using a catheter, Dr. Mahadevan and his team make a small cut in the skin to access a blood vessel – usually the femoral vein or artery in the groin, the jugular vein in the neck, or the aorta, which a cardiac surgeon can access by making a chest incision. Dr. Mahadevan then inserts a flexible tube into this vessel and threads it into the heart. The team uses imaging tools to guide them, including X&#45;ray or transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), in which an ultrasound probe is inserted down the throat and into the esophagus, which provides a good vantage point for gathering images of the heart.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Because these are not surgical procedures, interventional cardiologists cannot use scalpels to remove old valves. Instead, the replacement valve is designed to fit within the patient’s own degenerated &quot;native&quot; valve or a surgically implanted valve which is no longer functioning properly. Using a small inflatable balloon, the existing valve is flattened against the sides of the valve opening, similar to the way plaque is flattened against the sides of a blood vessel during an angioplasty.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The replacement valve is then threaded through the catheter into the heart. (These devices include the Edwards SAPIEN XT transcatheter aortic heart valve, which was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration this past summer, and Medtronic’s Melody® transcatheter pulmonary valve.) Similar to a stent, the replacement valve is folded into a slender cylinder until it reaches the target location, then fully expanded to fit within the valve opening.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;During this process, Dr. Mahadevan &quot;paces&quot; the heart, using a temporary pacemaker to briefly induce an abnormal heart rhythm called ventricular tachycardia. This temporarily lowers the blood pressure in the heart while the replacement valve is positioned and expanded; otherwise, the force of the pumping blood is so strong that the device would be spit out of the valve opening before it has a chance to be opened. An experienced team can usually complete a successful valve procedure in about two&#45;and&#45;a&#45;half hours, said Dr. Mahadevan.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Closing Holes in the Heart&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;He also uses transcatheter procedures to repair one of the most common heart defects – a hole in the septum, the wall that separates the right and left sides of the heart. Every baby is born with a small hole between the upper two chambers of the heart, which normally closes shortly after birth. When it fails to close, it results in a condition called patent foramen ovale (PFO). Atrial septal defects (ASDs) and ventricular septal defects (VSDs) are larger holes in the septum.
			
			&lt;p&gt;To patch these holes, Dr. Mahadevan can use a device such as the AMPLATZER™ septal occluder. It has a plug which fits into the hole, and discs which open on each side of the septum to seal off the two sides of the heart.
			
			&lt;p&gt;For most PFO and ASD closures, Dr. Mahadevan is experienced in using intracardiac echocardiography (ICE), inserting a small ultrasound probe into the heart to provide imaging guidance. Use of this imaging tool does not require general anesthesia, facilitating faster recovery after the procedure. Dr. Mahadevan was also the first interventional cardiologist in the UK to use three&#45;dimensional intracardiac echocardiography to guide procedures.
			 
			&lt;h3&gt;Building a World&#45;Class Center&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mahadevan has used catheter&#45;based procedures to implant at least 500 heart devices and nearly 200 heart valves. Although he specializes in treating adults with congenital heart defects, he also is well&#45;versed in the full range of interventional procedures, including angiograms, angioplasties and stents.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;Teamwork makes us successful,&quot; said Dr. Mahadevan. &quot;You need people who do these procedures on a regular basis, including clinicians, specialist nurses, the cath lab team, ward nurses – and you also need to work with interrelated specialties, like pediatrics, pulmonary hypertension, transplant, electrophysiology and cardiac surgery. Percutaneous valve implantation is still in its early stages, and I think it will revolutionize treatment. I don’t think it will supplant surgery anytime soon, but it will complement it, because there is always going to be a group of patients who will be very high risk for surgery.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In addition to his clinical work, Dr. Mahadevan has a keen interest in research, particularly in the areas of pulmonary hypertension and ion channel changes in tetralogy of Fallot, a complex congenital heart condition.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mahadevan was born in India and graduated from Stanley Medical College at the University of Madras in Chennai (formerly Madras). He completed his residency at Doncaster Royal Infirmary in the UK, followed by fellowships in cardiology research, interventional cardiology, adult congenital heart disease and intervention at Belfast City Hospital, Royal Victoria Hospital and Queens University in Belfast, Royal Brompton Hospital in London, and Toronto General Hospital in Canada. He served as a cardiologist at the Manchester Royal Infirmary from 2005 until his recruitment to UCSF this year.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mahadevan is married to Kritika Mahadevan, a food scientist. They have two young sons, Manish and Harish, and are enjoying exploring their new home town. &quot;The fog and the chilly wind are a bit reminiscent of England,&quot; said Dr. Mahadevan with a laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mahadevan is excited to join the team at UCSF. &quot;Coming here offers a new challenge and opportunity, and a more academic environment,&quot; he said. &quot;I hope to complement the existing programs in adult congenital cardiology and pulmonary hypertension. I want to set up a major transcatheter valve program, and make this a center for newer valve technologies. My hope is to make UCSF a world&#45;class center for adult congenital heart disease treatment and intervention.&quot;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;
			Is alcohol good or bad for the heart? The short answer: it depends, it.s complicated, and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://profiles.ucsf.edu/gregory.marcus&quot;&gt;Dr. Gregory Marcus&lt;/a&gt; is trying to find out more.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
			&quot;Alcohol is fascinating as it relates to cardiovascular health,&quot; said Dr. Marcus, a cardiac electrophysiologist who studies atrial fibrillation, an abnormal heart rhythm in which the upper chambers of the heart quiver ineffectively, rather than pumping blood efficiently. &quot;On one hand, there's evidence that moderate alcohol consumption might prevent heart attacks, be beneficial in heart failure, and help the cholesterol profile. Also, red wine might have beneficial components like antioxidants, which can help the health of blood vessels.
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			&quot;On the other hand, there's pretty good evidence that alcohol increases risk for atrial fibrillation and may raise blood pressure,&quot; said Dr. Marcus. However, some of the data is anecdotal, drawn from clinical experience of so&#45;called &quot;holiday heart syndrome,&quot; in which patients develop atrial fibrillation after drinking, often following a holiday or weekend.
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			&quot;The question is, is alcohol just triggering atrial fibrillation in those who already have the disease, or is it actually causing atrial fibrillation?&quot; asked Dr. Marcus. &quot;That's one of the things we need to figure out.&quot; He and his team hypothesize that there may be two dynamics at play: an acute effect, caused by a specific drinking episode, and a chronic effect, which unfolds over years of drinking.
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;u&gt;Alcohol and Atrial Fibrillation&lt;/u&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Although about 85 percent of Americans drink alcohol, little is known about how it affects the electrical properties of the heart. At the same time, while atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia, how it develops is poorly understood. Dr. Marcus recently received a grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to discover more about both these areas. &quot;If we could really understand the mechanisms by which alcohol leads to atrial fibrillation, we might learn something that could reveal a new target for therapies,&quot; he said.
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			The grant includes several projects:
			&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alcohol vs. placebo&lt;/i&gt;: Patients with atrial fibrillation can sometimes be helped or even cured through ablation &amp;mdash; a catheter&#45;based procedure to strategically burn or freeze the heart tissue producing the faulty electrical signals causing an arrhythmia. In this study, patients who are already scheduled to have an ablation are randomly divided into two groups. 
			&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
			Just before the ablation, one group receives an infusion of intravenous alcohol, which is titrated by repeated breathalyzer tests to achieve a blood alcohol concentration of .08%. The other group receives a placebo infusion. The electrophysiologists performing the procedures do not know whether the patient is receiving alcohol or the placebo. They perform tests before and after the infusion to determine the electrophysiologic properties of the upper chambers of the heart, and to see whether they can induce atrial fibrillation. &quot;The idea is to see how alcohol versus placebo changes the electrical properties of the heart,&quot; said Dr. Marcus. Dr. Jeffrey Olgin, chief of the Division of Cardiology, Gallo&#45;Chatterjee Distinguished Professor of Medicine, and a co&#45;investigator on Dr. Marcus's NIH&#45;funded study, is performing a similar set of experiments on rat hearts.
			&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Framingham collaboration&lt;/i&gt;: Dr. Marcus and his team are collaborating with investigators at the landmark &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/&quot;&gt;Framingham Heart Study&lt;/a&gt;, which was established in 1948 and has closely studied three generations of participants over decades to learn more about cardiovascular risk factors. Participants fill out detailed questionnaires and return to the study's headquarters every two years for a detailed medical history, physical examination and laboratory tests.
			&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
			Dr. Marcus is working with Framingham to review many years of serial alcohol surveys and echocardiograms, which are ultrasound images of the heart. &quot;The hypothesis is that consuming alcohol over a long period of time leads to an enlargement of the left atrium, which then leads to atrial fibrillation,&quot; said Dr. Marcus. His group is also conducting animal experiments to complement this investigation.
			&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Close monitoring&lt;/i&gt;: In the third project, Dr. Marcus and his team have recruited patients with intermittent atrial fibrillation to wear a heart monitor for a month to record their heart rhythm, as well as wrist and ankle monitors that detect the alcohol level in their sweat. By comparing the monitor readings, they hope to learn whether there is a relationship between alcohol consumption and atrial fibrillation, and if so, what the timing of that relationship is. An acute effect might produce atrial fibrillation shortly after alcohol enters the bloodstream, whereas a &quot;hangover&quot; effect might trigger the arrhythmia a day or two later. Participants will also provide a blood sample that can help determine whether they had any binge drinking episodes in the previous two weeks.
			&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
			The investigators also want to find out if there is a threshold concentration . a tipping point that sets off the arrhythmia &amp;mdash; and whether there are signature characteristics of the heart rhythm just before an alcohol&#45;associated atrial fibrillation episode begins, which might provide insight into how atrial fibrillation occurs.
			&lt;/ul&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;u&gt;Additional Investigations&lt;/u&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			
			Dr. Marcus also leads other related studies:
			&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dry to wet&lt;/i&gt;: Many previous investigations of alcohol and heart disease have a major limitation: they often rely on self&#45;reports of how much participants drink. Because of social taboos, participants may downplay the amount or frequency of their consumption, or feel pressured to inflate their drinking habits.
			&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
			Dr. Marcus and one of his research mentees, cardiac electrophysiology fellow Dr. Jonathan Dukes, have pursued an alternative route. They conducted a study of every hospitalization in Texas over five years using a database called the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project. Texas is of special interest because a number of its counties prohibit the sale of alcohol, likely a holdover from Prohibition. (Although alcohol consumption is legal in &quot;dry&quot; counties, people must purchase it in &quot;wet&quot; counties.) &quot;This legal patchwork within a single state has provided a rich opportunity for us to leverage those differences and conduct a natural experiment,&quot; said Dr. Marcus. 
			&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
			Dr. Marcus's group compared the rates of heart attack, atrial fibrillation and heart failure in dry versus wet counties. &quot;We found that in wet counties, where alcohol sales were most liberal, there was more atrial fibrillation, but less heart attacks and less heart failure,&quot; said Dr. Marcus.
			&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
			Interestingly, during the study's five&#45;year period, several counties changed their laws to legalize alcohol sales. &quot;When counties went from dry to wet, there was more atrial fibrillation when they became wet than when they were dry,&quot; said Dr. Marcus. &quot;Atrial fibrillation was always associated with more access to alcohol.&quot;
			&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
			Their group also found that in counties where alcohol sales were permitted, there was an increase in the number of hospital diagnoses for alcohol abuse and alcoholic liver disease, suggesting that there was a relationship between availability and consumption of alcohol and likely validating their original approach to this research question. They recently submitted their findings for publication.
			&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.health&#45;eheartstudy.org/&quot;&gt;Health eHeart Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;: Dr. Marcus also serves as co&#45;principal investigator of the web&#45;based Health eHeart Study, which has enrolled nearly 20,000 participants to date and uses Big Data approaches, smartphones, mobile health apps and other technology to better predict, prevent and treat heart disease.
			&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
			Dr. Marcus and another mentee, cardiology fellow Dr. Isaac &quot;Ziggy&quot; Whitman, analyzed data from the alcohol&#45;related questionnaire that all Health eHeart participants receive. About one&#45;third of participants thought alcohol was good for the heart, one&#45;third thought it was bad, and one&#45;third were unsure. &quot;In a separate survey, the one&#45;third that thought it was good for the heart reported drinking more alcohol than other respondents, and their number one source of information was the lay press &amp;mdash; not their physician,&quot; said Dr. Marcus. This is the first known study to assess these beliefs. Dr. Marcus believes it may be particularly important that such beliefs are associated with increased alcohol consumption, and that these beliefs are based primarily on information in the popular media rather than physician recommendations. 
			&lt;/uL&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
			All these studies underscore the need to understand more about the relationship between alcohol consumption and heart health, as well as how arrhythmias develop. &quot;If we could understand which patients are prone to what heart conditions, and knew exactly how alcohol affects the heart, we could personalize our recommendations,&quot; said Dr. Marcus. &quot;We might say, 'Mr. Smith, you would do better if you drank one to two glasses of wine a night,' or 'Mr. Jones, you should avoid alcohol.' But we don't yet know the answer, and we're very interested in figuring that out.&quot;
			&lt;/P&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;u&gt;An Ideal Study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
			
			If he had unlimited funds, Dr. Marcus would like to conduct a randomized controlled trial &amp;mdash; the &quot;gold standard&quot; of research. The study would enroll volunteers who would be willing to either drink alcohol or not, and randomize them to either a moderate drinking group or a non&#45;drinking group. &quot;If we had sufficient funding to enroll thousands of people and follow them for at least five years, that would be an outstanding opportunity to learn a lot about the relationship between alcohol and heart disease,&quot; said Dr. Marcus.
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			The Health eHeart Study may provide an infrastructure to support such an ambitious study, using mobile health apps, smartphone messaging, and other tech tools to gather a rich pool of data. &quot;This would be a completely innovative and very clinically meaningful research study,&quot; said Dr. Marcus, noting that randomized controlled trials are the best way to answer research questions. For example, a large, randomized controlled trial run by the Women's Health Initiative found in 2002 that hormone replacement therapy was more likely to harm than help women, overturning the conventional wisdom at the time.
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			&quot;An alcohol randomized study would be of interest far beyond cardiovascular health, gathering a humongous wealth of information that would be of interest to oncologists, gastroenterologists, endocrinologists, psychiatrists and many others,&quot; said Dr. Marcus.
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;u&gt;Health eHeart Collaborations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
			
			In addition to his investigations about alcohol and heart disease, Dr. Marcus is enthusiastic about the growing scope of the Health eHeart Study, which he co&#45;directs along with Dr. Olgin and Dr. Mark Pletcher, a cardiovascular epidemiologist. The study has enrolled participants from every state, as well as six continents and about 90 countries.
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			&quot;We are very excited by President Obama's &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.nih.gov/precisionmedicine/&quot;&gt;Precision Medicine Initiative&lt;/a&gt; that he mentioned in this year's State of the Union address, and think that what we're building is exactly what they're looking for,&quot; said Dr. Marcus. &quot;The Health eHeart Study is not just a cohort study, but a new paradigm for collecting clinical research.&quot; Dr. Olgin has been invited to be a member of the President's and NIH panel for this Precision Medicine Initiative. 
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Dr. Marcus and his team are collaborating with a number of other institutions, including UC Berkeley, the Childhood Cancer Survival Study and the Duke Clinical Research Institute. The Health eHeart Study also has established a close working relationship with the American Heart Association (AHA), which prominently featured the study at its most recent annual meeting, and helped enroll several thousand participants. In collaboration with &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://empoweredtoserve.heart.org/home&quot;&gt;EmPowered to Serve&lt;/a&gt;, an AHA initiative that works with faith&#45;based and community partners, the Health eHeart Study is recruiting more participants from underrepresented groups while providing tailored aggregate recommendations for community leaders about opportunities for members to improve their health.
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			The Health eHeart Study also works with the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.pcori.org/&quot;&gt;Patient&#45;Centered Outcomes Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;, a federally funded organization that promotes patient involvement in research studies. Led by Dr. Pletcher, the recently formed Health eHeart Alliance convened a patient&#45;investigator summit with about 50 patients and 20 researchers. Together they developed ideas for patient&#45;initiated research questions, such as creating a smartphone&#45;based algorithm to help determine the triggers for a particular patient's atrial fibrillation.
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;u&gt;Driven by Curiosity&lt;/u&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			
			Dr. Marcus grew up in Berkeley, and majored in philosophy at UC San Diego. He also took pre&#45;med classes, and wrote his honors thesis on medical ethics. &quot;I wanted there to be meaning in my life, and felt that saving lives was the simplest way to do that,&quot; he said.
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			After earning his medical degree at George Washington University in Washington, DC, he completed his residency and chief residency at Stanford University. He did his cardiology and cardiac electrophysiology fellowships at UCSF, where he also earned a master's degree in clinical research. Dr. Marcus joined the UCSF faculty in 2006. In addition to his research, Dr. Marcus sees patients in clinic, performs ablation procedures, and implants pacemakers and defibrillators.
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Dr. Marcus has a son in his 20s, and he and his wife, Jenny, have two young daughters. In addition to medicine and spending time with his family, Dr. Marcus enjoys playing basketball, skiing, and playing the drums.
			 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			&quot;I've always been very curious,&quot; said Dr. Marcus. &quot;I question things when the answer is, 'Well, that's just the way it is.' There's got to be a reason, and if we don't know it, it's just because we haven't figured it out yet. I love solving puzzles and challenging conventional wisdom.&quot;
			&lt;/P&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Dr. Scot Merrick, a UCSF cardiac surgeon and chief of the Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, spent many years on the crew team in high school and college. “In my opinion, rowing is one of the ultimate team sports,” he said. “You can’t go fast if you have one person slowing you down. If everyone is committed to going fast, watch out.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“Cardiac surgery is not a lot different,” he said. “It’s a team sport. And that’s what translates into good outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Merrick’s current teammates include outstanding surgical nurses, cardiac anesthesiologists, ICU nurses, ward nurses, the Division of Cardiology, and many others. Together they provide superior care before, during and after surgery, oftentimes to patients with complex conditions who have been referred from other centers all over California.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;A cardiothoracic surgeon, Dr. Merrick used to perform most of the adult heart and lung operations at UCSF, and now focuses on a wide range of adult cardiac surgeries, including bypass surgery, surgery of the aorta and its branches, and removing tumors of the heart. He specializes in fixing problems with the four heart valves, which may need repair or replacement due to a birth defect, complications from rheumatic fever or infection, or other reasons. Almost all valve procedures require open heart surgery, which involves administering general anesthesia, making an incision in the chest, temporarily stopping the patient’s heart, and putting the patient on a heart&#45;lung machine to ensure that all parts of the body receive adequate oxygen during the surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Mitral Valve Prolapse&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;One of the most common conditions that Dr. Merrick treats is myxomatous valve, also called mitral valve prolapse or floppy valve. It occurs when the mitral valve fails to close properly. “In my opinion, and in most valve surgeons’ opinions, you should be able to repair those valves almost 100% of the time,” said Dr. Merrick, who is internationally renowned for his skill in complex mitral valve repair.  “The mitral valve is a very forgiving structure. If you can eliminate the prolapse and maintain the symmetry of the valve, it’s almost always going to work. If you can fix your own valve, you’re better off than having an artificial valve put in, because you preserve the normal anatomy and retain the most efficient function.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The mitral valve is a parachute&#45;like structure, with two leaflets that are connected to the inside of the heart by a number of cords. The most common problem occurs when leaflet tissue becomes stretched or excess tissue develops, creating a gap between the two leaflets through which blood can flow backwards. “You just take a V&#45;shaped wedge of the excess leaflet tissue out, and you sew the two edges back together,” said Dr. Merrick. “You basically eliminate the redundancy, and the prolapse that occurs along with that.”&lt;/p&gt;
			 
			&lt;p&gt;Another cause of mitral valve prolapse occurs when one of the cords stretches or breaks, leaving a portion of the leaflet unsupported and causing blood to leak. While some surgeons use artificial suture material to repair this problem, Dr. Merrick has honed the ability to reposition some of the patient’s own cords to fix the prolapse. Most people have about 20 to 30 cords for each leaflet. “The beauty of the mitral valve is, there are quite a number of these cords that aren’t necessary for the structural integrity of the valve,” said Merrick. “In many cases, you can remove the attachment of those cords to the leaflet and move them around, without removing their attachment to the origin inside the heart.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Merrick carefully chooses a cord from an area of the leaflet that is already well supported, snips the end connected to the leaflet, then stitches it onto the area of the leaflet that needs support. In some cases, when the cord is elongated but not torn, Dr. Merrick shortens the cord to the correct length.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;When repairing the mitral valve, Dr. Merrick almost always fixes an accompanying problem. Over time, a leaky valve can cause the left ventricle to expand. This stretches the perimeter of the area where the mitral valve’s leaflets are attached, called the annulus. It becomes a vicious cycle: the leaking stretches the annulus, which in turn causes even more leaking.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;To correct this, Dr. Merrick sews on an annuloplasty ring. “The ring is calibrated to some very specific anatomic landmarks,” said Dr. Merrick. “You measure the height of the leaflets, and the ring is calibrated to that size. It restores the annulus to the correct size, and the leaflets will come right back together.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The original annuloplasty rings were made of metal, with cloth covering the outside so they could be stitched on. Dr. Merrick tends to use the latest model, made of more flexible material. It functions like an elastic belt, restoring the annulus to its proper dimensions while flexing with the movement of the heartbeat. Even though the ventricle may remain enlarged, it is not problematic. “As long as you eliminate the leak, the pattern of blood flow through the heart is restored to normal,” said Dr. Merrick.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;The Power of Imaging&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Merrick noted that landmark studies from the Mayo Clinic in the 1980s demonstrated that patients in need of mitral valve surgery experienced better outcomes when they were referred for surgery before they developed heart failure. At UCSF, Dr. Merrick works closely with his colleagues in the Division of Cardiology to develop an accurate diagnosis and create a customized treatment plan for each patient, including the best time for surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p&gt;“The big thing in mitral valve surgery that’s occurred in my lifetime is the introduction and perfection of echocardiography,” said Dr. Merrick. An echocardiogram is an ultrasound of the heart, which provides a wealth of information about the anatomy of the heart and patterns of blood flow. 
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;“It is the gold standard, not only for making a diagnosis, but mapping out what operation you can do,” said Merrick. “The echo is a spectacular way to look at the anatomy of the valve. It shows how it moves, how it works, and where it doesn’t close properly. You can tell, based on what segment of the leaflet is not working properly, where the anatomy is going to be faulty. I’d say 95 percent of the time, you know before you even make the incision exactly what you’re going to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;UCSF also has the advantage of using the most advanced imaging equipment, and having experts in performing and analyzing echocardiograms. “The people who do echocardiography here – Drs. Nelson Schiller, Elyse Foster – they’re just phenomenally good,” said Dr. Merrick. “They do perfect echoes. It’s great, because they can really sit down and help you understand the anatomy.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Aortic Valve Replacement Surgery&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Another common valve procedure that Dr. Merrick performs is aortic valve replacement surgery.  Sometimes, a patient’s aortic valve may not have formed properly before birth, or may wear out over time. In other cases, patients develop a heart infection like endocarditis, in which bacteria attack the aortic valve tissue. Sometimes this can cause the valve to leak, and may eventually require open heart surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;To perform an aortic valve replacement, Dr. Merrick cuts out the defective valve with scissors, and stitches in a replacement valve. There are two main types of valves. Mechanical valves are made of material like carbon fiber and are very long&#45;lasting, but require patients to take blood thinners for life to prevent clots from forming on the device. Tissue valves are made from a pig heart valve or the lining that surrounds a cow’s heart. They do not require patients to take blood thinners, but do wear out after 10 to 15 years. Dr. Merrick is reluctant to recommend a tissue valve for young people, because they calcify more quickly and wear out even faster – in about eight to 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“When someone is in need of surgery, it’s tough to figure out what kind of valve you’d want, especially if you’re in the 40 to 50 age range,” said Dr. Merrick. “You may still be really active and do athletic things, and you wouldn’t want to be on a blood thinner. But at the same time, you’d prefer not to have more surgery when you’re in your 60s or 70s, when your risk may be higher.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, a patient with extensive infections inside the heart may be a good candidate for a human valve. This is obtained the same way any donor tissue is procured, such as a kidney or liver, and has the advantage of being very resistant to infection. (Whether tissue valves come from animals or humans, they are specially treated so that the immunologically active proteins on their surface are denatured, so that recipients do not need to take immunosuppressant drugs to prevent rejection of their new valves.)&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Other Procedures&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Merrick also occasionally performs surgery on the pulmonary valve, which is located between the right ventricle and the artery which carries deoxygenated blood to the lungs. This valve rarely malfunctions, but may require surgical treatment for patients with a congenital heart defect such as tetralogy of Fallot.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The tricuspid valve, located between the right atrium and right ventricle, also sometimes requires surgery. “Even though it’s the most accessible valve on the heart, it’s probably the most unpredictable,” said Dr. Merrick. Many factors can contribute to a leaky tricuspid valve, including blockages in the lungs. Alternatively, a leaky mitral valve can cause blood to back up in the lungs, which in turn elevates pressure in the right side of the heart and can cause the tricuspid valve to leak – similar to a freeway accident causing traffic to back up for miles behind it. “If you’re operating on a leaky tricuspid valve, the key thing is to know what caused the high pressures,” said Dr. Merrick.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Looking to the Future&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Merrick noted that there are new surgical procedures on the horizon. For example, a recent trial tested the use of a percutaneous valve to replace a malfunctioning aortic valve. Instead of requiring open heart surgery and a heart&#45;lung machine, doctors use technology similar to that employed in cardiac catheterization. They make a small cut to gain access to a major blood vessel, such as the femoral artery in the groin area, then thread a compressed pig valve surrounded by a mesh metal housing through a patient’s arteries. When the valve is threaded into the heart, a balloon is inflated to open up the calcified valve, and then the compressed pig valve is deployed to expand to its full size – a bit like opening an umbrella. The irregular, hardened calcified surface actually provides an ideal framework for the expandable metal housing of the percutaneous valve to grab on to.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Currently, the only candidates for this less invasive procedure are older patients with aortic stenosis, a condition in which the aortic valve is calcified and has difficulty closing properly. “It works, and it certainly works better than nothing,” said Dr. Merrick. “But there are problems with it. It’s a new technology, and it’s not perfect yet. … It’s a hot topic right now.” The technique has been used in Europe, and approval in the United States is anticipated within the next year. Dr. Merrick said that if the procedure is approved, UCSF would like begin offering it to a select group of patients, most of whom are not candidates for traditional surgery due to age or other factors. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Another innovation is robotic surgery for mitral valve surgery, which uses a robot to make multiple small incisions on the side of the chest. The procedure takes longer than traditional open surgery, and the results are close to those achieved by traditional surgery, but not quite as good, said Dr. Merrick. This approach still requires the heart&#45;lung machine, but the incisions are smaller and more cosmetically pleasing than traditional surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“I always am reluctant to use the term ‘minimally invasive surgery,’ because any time you’re on the heart&#45;lung machine, that’s invasive, in my opinion,” said Dr. Merrick. “In fact, most surgery is invasive. The size of the incision is what you’re varying. For almost all valve surgery at this point in time, you have to use the heart&#45;lung machine. It’s the morbidity of the heart&#45;lung machine that people are trying to get away from, by doing percutaneous valves, for example.” &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Merrick noted that the results for traditional surgery keep improving – for example, operative mortality  for elective aortic valve replacement has dropped from about 7 percent to less than 3 percent, while the heart&#45;lung machine continues to get safer each year, and artificial valve technology continues to improve. It will take decades to learn how percutaneous valve surgery compares with traditional valve surgery in the long run, said Dr. Merrick.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;For the foreseeable future, some conditions will still require traditional open heart surgery. For example, to treat infection on valves, a surgeon must remove the infected tissue, similar to removing an abscess on a person’s skin; this requires a level of precision that is only possible with open surgery.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;Leading the Team&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Merrick grew up in Seattle, where he rowed in four&#45; and eight&#45;man shells in high school and college. Dr. Merrick still keeps a boat up in Puget Sound, and returns once or twice a month to row. He also sails in the Bay Area on his 23&#45;foot long sailboat.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;During medical school at the University of Washington, he thought he would become a cardiologist, but changed course when he started doing research in a cardiac surgery laboratory. “It was hard work, but I loved it,” he said. He came to UCSF for his residency training, working with Dr. Paul Ebert, then chair of the Department of Surgery and a world&#45;famous heart surgeon.  After his residency, Dr. Merrick joined the UCSF faculty, and has been here ever since. He currently performs about 150 surgeries a year.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In addition to serving as chief of the Division of Adult Cardiothoracic Surgery, Dr. Merrick also directs the thoracic surgery residency program. He recently led efforts to expand the program from two years to three to expose residents to a wider range of rotations and procedures.&lt;/p&gt; 
			
			&lt;p&gt;He is quick to point to his talented team of colleagues as the biggest reason for the successful outcomes of the surgeries he performs. “We’ve got great nurses in the OR who have been there a long time,” he said. “I’ve got fantastic cardiac anesthesiologists who are all fully trained in echocardiography. I’ve got a very experienced set of ICU nurses, and ward nurses who have been here almost as long as I have. And then I have a supportive group in Cardiology that are just phenomenal. I can’t claim any of that credit – that’s a credit to who comes to UCSF.”&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Cardiac electrophysiologist Dr. Joshua Moss sees parallels between his two passions: flying airplanes and helping patients with abnormal heart rhythms.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
			Dr. Moss has a private pilot’s license, and he loves the challenge of being in the air. “You have to be attentive and interpret a lot of information in real time from both cockpit instruments and the outside environment,” he said. It’s similar to the cardiac electrophysiology (EP) lab, where he uses catheter&#45;based energy to eliminate the sources of cardiac arrhythmias. “When performing an arrhythmia ablation procedure, you have to rapidly integrate a lot of different information, including EKGs, X&#45;ray images, ultrasounds, and three&#45;dimensional maps of the heart,” he said. “As with aviation, you have to pay attention to details and do things in the right order to make it safe.”
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
			Dr. Moss was recently recruited to the UCSF cardiology faculty from the University of Chicago, where he cared for some of the sickest patients. Many had advanced heart failure and received an implantable left ventricular assist device (LVAD), a miniaturized pump which keeps the body supplied with oxygenated blood when the heart is no longer up to the task.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
			These patients often tolerate arrhythmias that could be life&#45;threatening in patients without a pump, which keeps blood circulating regardless of electrical disturbances in the heart. “You or I could be dead in minutes or seconds, but patients with an LVAD who develop a ventricular arrhythmia might not even pass out,” said Dr. Moss. “Yet we don’t want to allow these abnormal rhythms to persist indefinitely. We developed new techniques for best managing dangerous arrhythmias in these very complex patients.”
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Almost all LVAD patients already have an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD), which shocks the heart back into a normal rhythm if a life&#45;threatening arrhythmia develops. “We’re also discovering the best ways to program the ICD for patients who get an LVAD,” said Dr. Moss. “A shock from an ICD can be a scary event, like your car’s airbag going off. If you’re in a serious crash, you’d like that airbag to fire – but you don’t want it going off for a minor fender bender, and it’s better to just tune up your brakes to avoid a crash altogether.”
			&lt;/P&gt;
			
			&lt;h4&gt;&lt;u&gt;From Engineering to Cardiology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Moss originally planned to become an engineer. He earned a bachelor’s degree in biomedical engineering from Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, working on projects that used electrical stimulation of muscles and nerves to restore function to spinal cord injury patients. As a mechanical engineering graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he helped design a retinal prosthesis that used electrical stimulation to restore vision to blind patients. Inspired by his interactions with patients and doctors, he decided to change career paths, and earned his medical degree from Harvard Medical School.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
			“I soon became enamored with the simplicity and power of the EKG,” said Dr. Moss, referring to the electrocardiogram, which records the heart’s electrical activity and displays it using line tracings on paper. “Despite being invented over 100 years ago, it’s still the first and most frequent heart test administered to most patients. Cardiac electrophysiology was a really good fit for my interests in patient care and engineering.”
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
			After internal medicine residency at the Massachusetts General Hospital, he completed fellowships in general cardiology and cardiac electrophysiology at the University of Pennsylvania. Among his mentors was Dr. Edward P. Gerstenfeld, now chief of the Cardiac Electrophysiology and Arrhythmia Service at UCSF Medical Center and the Melvin M. Scheinman Endowed Chair in Cardiology.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
			“We were very fortunate to be able to recruit Dr. Moss from the University of Chicago,” said Dr. Gerstenfeld. “Dr. Moss pioneered the use of catheter ablation to treat ventricular arrhythmias in patients with congestive heart failure and will expand our group’s ability to treat patients with more persistent forms of atrial fibrillation. He has also earned a reputation as a gifted educator.”
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
			During fellowship, Dr. Moss worked with engineers at the University of Illinois to develop highly flexible electronic circuit boards that conform to the curvatures of the heart. While at the University of Chicago, he worked with colleagues at the University of Colorado to develop methods to fine&#45;tune and focus radiofrequency ablation, one of the main tools for treating arrhythmias. Ablation functions a bit like a circuit breaker: by burning small portions of the heart where abnormal electrical impulses originate or circulate, electrophysiologists create tiny areas of scar tissue which will not transmit electricity, thereby interrupting the arrhythmia. Dr. Moss hopes to create tools to more precisely target the ablation energy, so difficult&#45;to&#45;reach areas can be treated with even lower risk of collateral damage.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
			Dr. Moss sees patients at the UCSF Cardiovascular Care and Prevention Center at Mission Bay, downtown at the new clinic on Daniel Burnham Court, and in the electrophysiology laboratory at UCSF Medical Center. He thoroughly enjoys patient care. “I like meeting new people, and feel very privileged to become a trusted part of their lives,” he said. “Many people with arrhythmias require longitudinal care, so you develop close friendships and follow their progress for years.” Several of his Chicago patients even trek out to San Francisco so they can continue seeing him at UCSF.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
			Dr. Moss is passionate about teaching. “In electrophysiology, there are a lot of complex concepts,” he said. “Rather than promoting rote memorization, I enjoy helping people understand the underlying concepts so they can derive the answers to any number of complicated questions.” He also appreciates teaching and learning from his colleagues at UCSF. “It’s a very academically inquisitive and curious group,” he said, citing their weekly fellow&#45;led conferences to discuss unusual cases. “People pore over every detail just for the sake of learning. Everybody wants to do the best they can for the patients, and part of that is making sure that you’re always learning from every case. Even people with years and years of experience are still interested in other people’s opinions, and are constantly re&#45;evaluating their own approach.”
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
			Outside of medicine, Dr. Moss enjoys spending time with his wife and their young son and daughter. He is a member of the JATO Aviation flying club in San Carlos, and recently flew his son to Legoland in Southern California.

			&lt;img src=&quot;http://profiles.ucsf.edu/profile/Modules/CustomViewPersonGeneralInfo/PhotoHandler.ashx?person=5195402&amp;ShowSilhouetteAsDefault=True&quot; class=&quot;imgLeft&quot; style=&quot;margin&#45;top:10px;width:125px;&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;You don’t have to be the Bionic Man to have electricity coursing through your body. In fact, we all have electricity at work in our brains and heart. Electrophysiology is the study of electrical properties of cells and tissues, and Dr. Jeffrey Olgin, chief of the Division of Cardiology, is one of the world’s leading experts in the field of cardiac electrophysiology.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“I’ve always found it fascinating,” Dr. Olgin said. “It’s a very logical field – it’s physics. And from a clinical standpoint, you can actually cure people with very high rates.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;A healthy heart beats regularly, powered by electrical impulses from within the heart. However, disturbances in the way these electrical impulses start or propagate can cause heart rhythm disturbances (called arrhythmias), in which the heart may beat too fast, too slowly, or irregularly. There are many different types of arrhythmias, and it often takes quite a bit of detective work to accurately diagnose what type of arrhythmia a patient has.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Investigating Atrial Fibrillation&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;One of the most common forms of cardiac arrhythmia is atrial fibrillation, which affects about 3 million people in the United States. It occurs when the atria, the upper chambers of the heart, quiver rather than beating effectively. “If you were to look at the atrium [during atrial fibrillation], it looks like a bag of worms,” said Dr. Olgin, wiggling his fingers to imitate the disorganized muscular movement rather than the concerted pumping action of a healthy heart. Although atrial fibrillation is usually not fatal by itself, blood clots can form when the atrium is not effectively pumping out blood. If a clot becomes lodged in the brain, it can cause a stroke.
			
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Researchers still do not know what causes atrial fibrillation, but it is associated with high blood pressure, aging and sleep apnea. “We believe that atrial fibrillation is a late manifestation of a disease process,” said Dr. Olgin. “It may take years to develop the necessary changes in the atria that ultimately result in atrial fibrillation.” His research seeks to determine more about how this actually happens, in order to develop more effective interventions. Dr. Olgin’s current theory is that many patients with atrial fibrillation have fibrosis, or microscopic scars between heart cells. These scars do not conduct electricity well, and so when electricity pulses through the atrium, instead of flowing through in a smooth and coordinated wave, the impulse can become scattered and diffused.&lt;/p&gt;
			 
			&lt;p&gt;Using a state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art technique called optical mapping, Dr. Olgin is able to conduct experiments to determine the electrical activity of the heart to study atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias in the research lab. Thanks to new technology, Dr. Olgin can now see how electricity moves through the heart with a level of detail that was impossible just five years ago. Dr. Olgin is trying to find ways to intervene in the scarring process. “We’ve found one particular protein that seems to be a culprit,” he said. “In animal studies, if we prevent that protein from working, we can prevent the atrial fibrillation from occurring.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Stem Cell Collaboration&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p&gt;Today, people who survive a heart attack have scar tissue in the heart that no longer contracts, and can interfere with the heart’s ability to pump blood. Medications and other therapies can improve symptoms, but as Dr. Olgin says, “Right now, we can’t make the pump better.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Someday that may change, thanks to the potential of stem cells. Stem cells are unspecialized cells that have the potential to develop into many different cell types, such as brain, blood or heart cells. For the past few years, Dr. Olgin has been collaborating with Dr. Lior Gepstein, who is based at Technion – Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa, Israel. “Lior is one of the leading cardiac stem cell researchers in the world,” said Dr. Olgin. “He was the first person to take a stem cell and make a heart cell.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gepstein recently spent a two&#45;year sabbatical at UCSF on a project that has now developed into an ongoing collaboration with Dr. Olgin. “We’re trying to see if we can use stem cells to treat arrhythmias, and finding ways to make sure cells integrate electrically,” said Dr. Olgin. With a laugh, he added, “Lior is the cell guy, and I’m the electrician. You need both.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;One of the questions they are investigating is how stem cells could be used to regenerate heart tissue in the border zone between scar tissue and normal tissue. “It’s in that border zone where all the arrhythmias originate after a heart attack,” said Dr. Olgin. In those zones, healthy and dead tissue are mixed, and sometimes electrical impulses flowing through that area go haywire. Dr. Olgin and Dr. Gepstein are trying to find ways to regenerate enough healthy cells in border areas to prevent arrhythmias from developing.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;They are also looking at ways to create heart cells that could be trained to beat spontaneously, perhaps someday allowing dead heart tissue to be replaced by “tissue patches,” almost like skin grafts. But it is critical that any implanted cells also be able to “talk” electrically with the native cells around them.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Imagine a stadium full of people trying to do “the wave.” If one section of the bleachers is filled with fans who are blindfolded and listening to their iPods, they probably would not stand up and wave their arms at the right time, disrupting the whole group’s effort. Dr. Olgin is similarly trying to discover ways to make sure that stem cells are electrically in sync with their neighbors, particularly through the use of proteins called connexons.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;This collaboration has huge potential to help people who have had heart attacks or heart failure. However, because Dr. Gepstein is based in Israel, it is very difficult to obtain funding from the National Institutes of Health. A generous donor has already contributed $2 million to the project, and has offered to match other contributions up to an additional $1 million. “This is a unique collaboration, and it allows us to share ideas and techniques,” said Dr. Olgin. “We wouldn’t be able to do this without philanthropy.”&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h2&gt;The Heart of a Mother&lt;/h2&gt;
			&lt;img width=&quot;100&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; style=&quot;margin&#45;bottom:25px;&quot; class=&quot;imgLeft&quot; src=&quot;http://profiles.ucsf.edu/profile/Modules/CustomViewPersonGeneralInfo/PhotoHandler.ashx?NodeID=31153327&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot; style=&quot;padding:0;&quot;&gt;
			“We think of pregnancy as a cardiometabolic stress test,” said Dr. Nisha Parikh (pronounced “KNEE&#45;sha pah&#45;REEK”). “If you can get through pregnancy without preeclampsia, diabetes, preterm delivery or a small infant, your chances of having heart disease are less than a woman with one of those complications.” &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Parikh investigates the effects of normal and abnormal pregnancy on future cardiovascular disease risk in women. She has received grants to develop a tool that draws upon a patient’s reproductive history to identify women earlier who are at increased risk for heart disease. Such a tool would be free, non&#45;invasive, and could be used as soon as a woman has finished having children – perhaps 10 to 20 years earlier than current risk assessment. “It’s an exciting area for research, and is just starting to get attention from the cardiology and public health communities,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Framingham Experience&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Parikh grew up in Los Angeles and Saudi Arabia, where her father worked as a structural engineer. At UC Berkeley, she earned her bachelor’s degree in molecular and cellular biology and immunology and her masters of public health. She then completed her medical degree at New York Medical College in Valhalla, NY, her residency at Tufts&#45;New England Medical Center in Boston, and her clinical and research cardiology fellowship at Harvard Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;She also completed a cardiovascular epidemiology research fellowship at Boston University School of Medicine, working with the Framingham Heart Study. Established in 1948, this landmark research effort originally recruited 5,200 adults in Framingham, MA, to identify major risk factors for cardiovascular disease. It now follows three generations of participants.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“For cardiovascular epidemiology, it is the Mecca of research,” she said. “The most amazing thing is that although participants have spread out across the country and world, they keep flying back on their own dime for visits because they recognize the impact they’re having on preventing cardiovascular disease.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;During her Framingham years, Dr. Parikh investigated the intersection of kidney and heart disease. As a new mother, she also wondered whether breastfeeding had any relation to cardiovascular health. While pregnant women were excluded from follow&#45;up visits at Framingham, Dr. Parikh tracked down a breast health questionnaire that had been mailed to some participants. She found that children who were breastfed tended to have higher HDL (the “good” cholesterol) and lower body mass index in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“I think Framingham and so many other cardiovascular disease cohorts excluded pregnant women because they experience changes in blood pressure, body mass index, lipid profile and insulin resistance,” said Dr. Parikh. “But I am interested in pregnant women for those exact reasons. Eighty&#45;five percent of women have children, so it’s important to understand these physiologic changes better, and to not assume that everything goes back to normal after pregnancy.” She is currently analyzing information from the NIH&#45;established Women’s Health Initiative, as well as a cohort in northern Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Patient Care and Research&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;After her fellowships, Dr. Parikh worked for Kaiser Permanente in Hawaii, then served as a cardiologist and associate director of the clinical fellowship program at Queens Medical Center /University of Hawaii. She decided to join the UCSF faculty in part because of the outstanding research opportunities, and is particularly excited about the Health eHeart Study – a web&#45;based cohort which the UCSF Division of Cardiology hopes will eventually enroll up to a million people. The study allows participants to use smartphones and other devices to contribute information about their heart rate, exercise habits and a wealth of other data points.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In addition to her research, Dr. Parikh is establishing her general cardiology clinic at UCSF. “It’s very satisfying when patients realize how they can change their lifestyle to prevent future heart problems,” she said. “I enjoy thinking about everything I can do to help them.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Parikh is married to Sharad Vivek, who works in business development for Twitter. Together they have two daughters, Laila and Kinneri, and a son, Zubin. Dr. Parikh is an avid traveler, and also enjoys cooking and jewelry making.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Photo credit: Elisabeth Fall.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Cardiovascular disease is the leading killer in the US and throughout the Americas – and Dr. Melissa Burroughs Peña, a cardiologist with a keen interest in Latin America, is an emerging leader in improving heart health across the region.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The widespread availability of fast food, growing rates of obesity and diabetes, and low access to preventive treatments such as statins contribute to the &quot;perfect storm&quot; of heart disease that is impacting Latin America, said Dr. Burroughs Peña. Unfortunately, it also hits patients at much younger ages than the US.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s not just grandmothers having heart attacks, but people in their 30s, 40s and 50s who are supporting families and can no longer can work,&quot; said Dr. Burroughs Peña. &quot;It can sink a family very quickly, and is devastating to local communities and national economies.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Burroughs Peña grew up in Atlanta, where her father was a hospital administrator, and wanted to become a doctor since age three. Her high school Spanish teacher cultivated global and cultural awareness in addition to teaching the language. As a college student, Dr. Burroughs Peña spent a summer in Cuba, the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. &quot;We met with all kinds of people, including physicians, and after that summer I was just hooked,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;After graduating from Emory University with bachelor’s degrees in anthropology and human biology, she attended Harvard Medical School, then completed internal medicine residency at UCSF and cardiology and advanced echocardiography fellowships at Duke University, where she also earned a master of science in global health. She joined the UCSF faculty in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;She has returned to Latin America many times for training and research. Some of her early projects focused on HIV, since many global health efforts arose in the ’80s and ’90s in response to the AIDS epidemic. She frequently collaborates with researchers in HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases, partnering with existing research sites to investigate cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;During cardiology fellowship, she moved to Peru for a year with her husband, infant daughter, mother and the family Chihuahua. She helped conduct a study of cardiovascular risk factors in multiple settings, including rural, urban, high altitude and sea level environments. Dr. Burroughs Peña performed echocardiograms – ultrasounds of the heart – of nearly 200 participants, and also learned about their barriers to care, such as difficulty accessing low&#45;cost medicines. &quot;I think the best kind of research comes from the ground up, hearing people talk about their problems and what they need,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Because of her research, she developed a particular interest in echocardiography. &quot;It’s a powerful tool, because it’s so portable and inexpensive,&quot; she said. &quot;I can take an ultrasound machine the size of a thick laptop, and use it in any part of the world for research or clinical work.&quot; She has even brought it into the living rooms of homebound study participants in Lima.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Burroughs Peña hopes to apply her research towards shaping national and global health policy. &quot;It’s a way to have a big impact on a lot of people, especially with chronic disease,&quot; she said. &quot;A lot of our patients’ decisions are informed by their environment – for example, if there’s a grocery store near where they work or live, what it offers, and how much it costs…. The thing that drives me is looking at how poverty puts people at risk for cardiovascular disease. What can we intervene on from a policy standpoint to prevent cardiovascular disease in low&#45;income communities?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Burroughs Peña thinks that the UCSF Division of Cardiology is uniquely positioned to be a world leader in global cardiovascular health. &quot;We’ve got very strong global health at UCSF, as well as resources and support both within the University and our city,&quot; she said. &quot;I’m excited to be here when we’re growing this aspect of the Division.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Burroughs Peña is married to Eslier Peña, a chef. Together they have two young children, Mariah and Marcel.

			&lt;img src=&quot;http://profiles.ucsf.edu/profile/Modules/CustomViewPersonGeneralInfo/PhotoHandler.ashx?person=5237397&amp;ShowSilhouetteAsDefault=True&quot; class=&quot;imgLeft&quot; style=&quot;margin&#45;top:10px;&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;“When I went to medical school, I suppose I wanted to be like Ben Casey – wasn’t he the neurosurgeon with all the girlfriends?” asked Dr. Tom Ports with a chuckle, citing the lead character from the 1960s television series of the same name. “My first rotation at medical school was, ironically, oversubscribed. I was sent to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for my very first rotation. It looks like I've been there ever since.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Dr. Ports – who is the director of interventional cardiology – has performed close to 30,000 interventional procedures so far in his career. Cardiac catheterization involves inserting a thin plastic tube, or catheter, into an artery or vein in a patient’s leg or arm. The catheter can then be threaded through the blood vessel to the heart, where it can be used to perform diagnostic tests and treatments. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;These include everything from coronary angiograms – in which a special dye is injected to show whether arteries are blocked – to coronary angioplasty, in which a tiny balloon is inflated in a clogged artery to widen it. Dr. Ports often inserts stents, or small tubes, to help keep the artery open. He has also pioneered many other state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art techniques over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Saving Lives&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;“What I like about interventional cardiology is that it gives you the chance to work with your hands, on procedures that are very gratifying,” Dr. Ports said. “It's not often that you get to save a life. There's probably no greater feeling than that.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;There are many things that can cause heart attacks besides clogged arteries, and Dr. Ports enjoys the challenge of getting to the root of a patient’s heart problem. “Having done this now for 30 years, I've often thought I've seen everything that I could possibly see,” he said. “But almost every month I'll see something that's a little different than I've ever expected. We see people with congenital problems, infections in the heart, tearing of the aorta, and then bizarre toxicities like strychnine poisoning.”&lt;/p&gt;
			 
			&lt;p&gt;About half of the patients he treats come in through the emergency room, and with his colleagues Dr. Andrew Boyle and Dr. Yerem Yeghiazarians, he is on rotating call. “We have the mantra, ‘Time is muscle,’” Dr. Ports said. “The heart needs constant blood flow. If you interrupt that for a matter of seconds, the heart muscle starts to suffer, and the patient usually has chest pain.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“We have a goal of opening up the artery within 90 minutes of when the patient comes to the emergency room door,” Dr. Ports said. “In the cath lab, we have a personal goal of having the artery open within 30 minutes of when they get to the cath lab. So that means prepping the patient, discovering where the problem is, and then fixing it within that period of time. We've been very successful over the last several years in achieving that goal in virtually everybody.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“He is an outstanding physician,” said Dr. Kanu Chatterjee. “He’s one of the best, no question about it. When he was a fellow, he did a lot of very good research. By himself, he has developed all the recent interventions, not just coronary artery angioplasty or stent. He has trained so many interventional cardiologists all over the country now. Besides that, he is a superb clinician. He feels for his patients. That’s the greatest qualification I can think of. Tom is, no question, a fantastic person and physician.”&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;Training the Next Generation&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Born and raised in Ohio, Dr. Ports went to medical school at Ohio State University and did his residency at the University of Chicago Hospitals and Clinics. He came to UCSF in 1976 as cardiology fellow, and joined the faculty in 1978. Dr. Ports has seen the field change enormously, thanks to advances in imaging, X&#45;ray technology, and the increasing miniaturization of equipment. “It’s allowed us to do things today that I wouldn’t have thought possible five years ago, and I certainly wasn’t thinking about 30 years ago,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ports is a natural teacher, and keeps a model of a heart on his desk and a catheter in his filing cabinet to illustrate the details of a procedure. A big part of Dr. Ports’s job is training cardiology fellows, as well as interventional cardiology fellows, who spend an additional two years after their cardiology fellowship focusing on interventional procedures. “They are a key part of the team, but they are also what keeps many of us here, because we enjoy teaching them as well as learning from them,” said Dr. Ports.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Teaching interventional procedures is a highly specialized skill. “It’s a two&#45;person operation anyway, so you are right there next to them,” he said. “It's like a pilot and copilot landing an airplane. I'm fairly patient, but also vigilant and know when to step in, and when to let someone else do the procedure for the most part. The only way to learn is to do it.” Generally, cardiology fellows in their first three years of training do not get involved in emergency cases. “When minutes count, we need the quickest and the best pair of hands,” Dr. Ports said.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;He said one of the most difficult parts of his job is wearing 30 pounds of lead clothing to protect himself from constant radiation exposure. “For the individual patient, the radiation exposure isn’t much,” Dr. Ports said. “But if you're doing five or 10 of these a day, over the years, it builds up.” He noted that the leading cause of early retirement for interventional cardiologists is spinal injuries related to wearing the heavy protection. “I use the same weightlifting belt I've had for 30 years, although I am on my last notch,” he said with a laugh. “I have to watch my weight!”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Besides cardiology, one of Dr. Ports’s passions is golf. He is a certified member of the Professional Clubmakers’ Society, and recently passed board exams in making golf clubs. He lives in San Francisco with his wife, and has one son in high school and another who is a PhD student at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot; style=&quot;width:97%;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Photo credit: Elisabeth Fall.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Dr. Rajni Rao, ambulatory service chief for the Division of Cardiology, has a passion for elegant design – whether it's a mid&#45;century pedestal table or a health care delivery system. &quot;What I like about good design is that somebody has put a lot of thought into it, understands the needs of the end users, and does it with beauty,&quot; said Dr. Rao.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;She brings that spirit of continual improvement to her leadership role in streamlining computer systems, work flows and other day&#45;to&#45;day aspects of the clinic which can be a source of constant frustration to patients and providers if poorly designed – or support the best doctor&#45;patient interactions if optimized. By minimizing time wasted on inefficient processes, Rao strives to create an environment where the health care team can be fully present for the patient.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;'Efficiency' can be an impersonal word, but if it results in just one extra minute with a patient, it can be the difference between getting the diagnosis right or wrong, or making a connection with someone or not,&quot; said Dr. Rao.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;She also envisions a future where doctors, nurses and other team members can use technology to offer more comprehensive care between visits – freeing up time during face&#45;to&#45;face visits for more substantial interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don't like 'checkbox medicine,' where the patient comes in and we go down the list – 'Let me order this and that, check, check, check,'&quot; said Dr. Rao. &quot;My vision of future clinic visits is that all that is tucked in before they come, and we use our skills as diagnosticians and healers to say, 'Let's talk about your symptoms, your quality of life, your valve disease, your surgery – what do you want out of your life, and how can I help you achieve your goals?' It's a completely different way to practice medicine.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Team Effort&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;One concrete example of improving the patient experience is reducing wait times. When the clinic first opened in 2010, patients were routinely waiting 40 minutes just to get from the waiting area to an exam room. Dr. Rao and Brenda Mar, the clinic administrative director, worked together closely with their team to cut that time, which is now zero to 15 minutes. &quot;There wasn't one day when the clinic suddenly improved, but we kept putting pressure on the system to improve, though there is a long way to go,&quot; said Dr. Rao. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Along with other colleagues throughout UCSF Health, Dr. Rao and Mar have completed Lean management training, a continuous process improvement model originally drawn from Toyota. Lean strives to maximize value to customers or patients, while minimizing waste.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;There is a Lean phrase, 'Go to gemba,' which is a Japanese word that means 'Go to the work floor and talk to workers,'&quot; said Dr. Rao. &quot;This is actually the most fun part of my job, and provides the highest yield – observing our staff and asking lots of questions. By stepping back and watching what people are doing, I find that people are often not able to take the straightest path from A to B. We can help simplify things for them that can also lead to downstream improvements for patients and providers. The next phase of Lean implementation is empowering front&#45;line staff to actively recognize problems and suggest ways to improve. Employees who are not physicians have such a massive and underappreciated role in delivering health care – they are mission critical.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Part of this team approach is a daily 10&#45;minute huddle, where staff gather around a whiteboard that serves as a &quot;visibility board&quot; to run through the day's quality metrics and the next day's game plan. They update stats like the number of patients waiting to be scheduled for appointments and the number of unfilled new patient slots, and ask a daily question such as &quot;What is the correct method for checking blood pressure in clinic?&quot;   &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;I've learned that the 20 or 30 minutes I'm in the room with a patient is just the tip of the iceberg,&quot; said Dr. Rao. &quot;When there's churn in the system, by the time patients come see me, they can be anxious, and may not have had all the tests they need. Selfishly, I wanted to make clinic better for me, but I also realized I could have a role in helping the entire Division achieve its goals.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Inspiring Educators&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rao grew up in Dallas, then spent her teen years in Palo Alto where her father worked in the semiconductor industry. She earned her bachelor's degree in biology at Harvard in three years, minoring in women's studies with the intention of becoming an obstetrician&#45;gynecologist.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;During her first weeks at UCSF as a medical student, Dr. Rao studied the cardiovascular system with Dr. Kanu Chatterjee, a legendary clinician and teacher who died in 2015. Dr. Chatterjee asked for a volunteer to demonstrate the pulse exam, and Dr. Rao stepped up. &quot;He demonstrated the correct technique, and his artful use of the physical examination and respectful patient interaction enraptured me,&quot; said Dr. Rao. &quot;Even though I wasn't his patient, at that moment, I felt calm and cared for, and it was a really powerful experience.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
			 
			&lt;p&gt;As an internal medicine resident at UCSF, Dr. Rao was again inspired by watching Dr. Chatterjee on the Coronary Care Unit (CCU), and the mutual respect he shared with the CCU nurses. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Those interactions, as well as training with other cardiologists at UCSF, including Dr. Joel Karliner, Dr. Elyse Foster, Dr. Ann Bolger, Dr. Nora Goldschlager, Dr. Teresa De Marco and many others, inspired Dr. Rao to choose a career in cardiology. &quot;I realized that cardiovascular disease is the number one killer of women, so it wasn't that big of a deviation to take my interest in women's health and apply it to cardiology,&quot; said Dr. Rao.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;She completed her internship at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, then returned to UCSF for residency and fellowships in cardiology and advanced echocardiography.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;She became intrigued by the puzzle&#45;solving challenge of cardiac echocardiography, which is ultrasound of the heart. &quot;Drs. Nelson Schiller and Elyse Foster have made echo such a core diagnostic test at UCSF that everybody from all over the hospital comes to the echo lab to understand cardiology,&quot; said Dr. Rao. &quot;You feel a bit like a medical detective, looking at the image and trying to figure out who this person is, why they came in, why they fainted or had an arrhythmia. When you see the heart moving and you understand the physiology, everything else that seems abstract becomes real.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rao relishes the rich educational environment of the echo lab, which has numerous medical students, residents, fellows, faculty and others coming through. &quot;There's a lot of on&#45;the&#45;fly teaching of our craft and field, and it's just a really enjoyable place to work,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
				
			&lt;p&gt;Inspired by many educators at UCSF, Dr. Rao has become a leader in teaching the next generation of physicians, and received a Haile T. Debas Academy of Medical Educators Excellence in Teaching Award in 2014.
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;My greatest joy is the on&#45;one&#45;one interaction with a student – sitting down with a student and deconstructing their experience and where they can go in their career and life, and where they can grow,&quot; said Dr. Rao. &quot;I'm a straight shooter. We have to be the guardians of our own profession, and part of that is training people to hold the highest standards for themselves. I always tell people to give 120 percent, and even if you are doing well, that's good, but think about where you can push and challenge yourself.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Tailoring Care&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In addition to teaching, interpreting echocardiograms, and working to improve clinic systems, Dr. Rao sees general and preventive cardiology patients. She has also developed an interest in cardio&#45;oncology, or the care of patients with cancer who also have cardiac conditions. In collaboration with UCSF gastrointestinal oncologist Dr. Emily Bergsland and an interdisciplinary team, Dr. Rao and her colleagues provide tailored care for complex patients with rare gastrointestinal neuroendocrine carcinoid tumors, which produce hormones that can result in severe heart valve disease. They may be too frail for open heart surgery to repair or replace their faulty valves.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;We craft a plan for each patient, weighing the risks and benefits of doing something for their heart against how that will affect their overall function with the added burden of cancer,&quot; said Dr. Rao. One option is placing a prosthetic valve through a catheter, similar to the process used to implant a cardiac stent – which only requires a small incision in the groin, in combination with or in lieu of open heart surgery. &quot;Maybe it doesn't fix the whole problem, but for complex patients, sometimes we need to be a little creative and come up with alternatives,&quot; said Dr. Rao, noting that this approach is investigational in this rare disease. She appreciates partnering with her heart team colleagues, including adult cardiothoracic surgeon Dr. Scot Merrick and interventional cardiologist Dr. Vaikom Mahadevan, to devise innovative approaches for these unique patients.  &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;She brings that same creativity to her ongoing efforts to reimagine ways to provide care for a much more common condition: high blood pressure. In collaboration with the UCSF School of Pharmacy as well as partners across campus and industry, she is launching the UCSF HIPSTER (&lt;span style=&quot;text&#45;decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;ypertension – &lt;span style=&quot;text&#45;decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;nnovating &lt;span style=&quot;text&#45;decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;ersonalized &lt;span style=&quot;text&#45;decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;Trategies for &lt;span style=&quot;text&#45;decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;xcellent &lt;span style=&quot;text&#45;decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;esults) project. It will design and pilot a portfolio of engagement strategies to better manage patients’ high blood pressure in and out of the clinic. HIPSTER seeks to unobtrusively measure blood pressure at home, enable patients to make their own connections between lifestyle and blood pressure changes, and alert a care team when swift intervention is needed. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;We’re hoping to develop home&#45;based monitoring and enhance patient communication with our care delivery,&quot; said Dr. Rao. &quot;Patients should not have to wait months or years to get their blood pressure under control. That apparent lack of urgency can undermine the message we really wish to convey, which is that control of blood pressure is of paramount importance.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;On the other hand, office visits just to discuss blood pressure may be an outdated model for many patients,&quot; said Dr. Rao. &quot;Not only is it inconvenient for patients, but increasing evidence also suggests that their blood pressure at home or at work – where they live their life – may be as or more important than the blood pressure we measure in clinic. We should continuously iterate on our methods to work with patients outside of the office to achieve their goals. We are excited to develop new technological tools to help us do this in ways that are convenient for patients and sustainable for clinicians.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;HIPSTER is one example of how Dr. Rao wants to improve management of chronic disease. She also hopes to eventually offer a menu of options for patients, tailored to their needs and preferences for how their receive care. &quot;If you want to come and see me, that’s fine,&quot; said Dr. Rao. &quot;But if you are a busy working parent and can’t take time off from work, we can communicate through an app. If you’re a homebound senior and don’t speak English, maybe your daughter does and she is on email, so let’s recruit caregivers like her to help elderly people at home. The goal is to use technology to increase our communication and touch with patients, finding the right fit that’s individualized for each person.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rao is married to Dr. Uday Kumar, a medical device entrepreneur who trained in cardiology and cardiac electrophysiology at UCSF. Dr. Kumar invented the ZIO® Patch, a wearable cardiac monitor used to detect abnormal heart rhythms. He is currently the founder, president and chief executive officer of Element Science and a consulting associate professor of bioengineering at Stanford University, where he also serves as the director of strategy of the Biodesign Program. Dr. Rao and Dr. Kumar live in San Francisco with their three young children, Sareena, Janavi and Rohan. In her rare free time, Dr. Rao enjoys listening to podcasts about design, perusing magazines like Dwell, and reading to her children. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;div style=&quot;width:370px;float:right;margin&#45;left:20px;&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/ucsfhealthcardiology.ucsf.edu/files/images/redberg2.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin&#45;top:10px;max&#45;width:96%;&quot; class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot; style=&quot;width:97%;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Photo credit: Elisabeth Fall.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Although the US spends more per person on health care than any other country, Americans rank lower on life expectancy and other health measures than many other countries in the developed world. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;Much of that is because we spend a lot of money on very expensive technologies that don’t lead to better patient outcomes,&quot; said Dr. Rita Redberg, a cardiologist and health policy expert. &quot;When I studied the issue more, I became convinced that some tests were not just wasteful, but also harmful, because they lead to unnecessary procedures where patients do not receive any benefit, but are only subject to harms.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Redberg grew up in modest circumstances in Brooklyn. Due to financial limitations, neither of her parents graduated from high school, and Dr. Redberg was the first in her family to attend college. &quot;I was always taught not to waste things,&quot; she said. That early training helped her put herself through college and medical school, and has contributed to her longstanding interest in assessing value and waste in the health care system. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Redberg was always interested in math and science, and attended James Madison High School – alma mater of US Supreme Court Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg and Senator Bernie Sanders, among others. In her final semester, she was among the first students enrolled in City&#45;as&#45;School, an experiential learning high school that allowed students to have educational experiences all over New York City. &quot;We got a bag of subway tokens every Monday morning, and one of the things I had chosen was to work at a hospital, shadowing doctors,&quot; recalled Dr. Redberg. &quot;I decided medicine would be a great way to combine my interest in helping people with science.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;She majored in biology at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., then earned her medical degree from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia. During medical school, she also earned a master’s degree from the London School of Economics, focusing on health policy and performing a cost&#45;effectiveness analysis of heart transplant surgery in Great Britain and the US. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Her advisor in medical school, Dr. John Eisenberg, also had an interest in health policy. One of his research studies focused on whether he could change residents’ routine ordering of daily laboratory tests for hospitalized patients. &quot;That really changed the way I looked at medicine,&quot; said Dr. Redberg. &quot;Before then, I had never questioned whether someone who above me was ordering tests that might not always be necessary. You get information from any test, but is it meaningful, and does it actually change the way you manage that patient and lead to better outcomes?&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Redberg completed her internal medicine residency at Columbia&#45;Presbyterian Medical Center in New York, and was applying to be a Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholar to pursue health policy. At the last minute, a cardiology fellowship position opened up at Columbia, and her professors encouraged her to take it. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;I said, ‘I like cardiology, but I am going to pursue health policy,’ and they said, ‘You can do health policy and cardiology!’&quot; said Dr. Redberg. Because cardiology is a technology&#45;intensive specialty, it was a good fit for her interest in technology assessment – evaluating how new technology is used in health care. &quot;Some things you plan, and some things happen,&quot; she said. &quot;Cardiology happened.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;She completed advanced fellowship training in non&#45;invasive cardiology at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York and the UCSF Cardiovascular Research Center, joining the UCSF faculty in 1991. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Learning the Legislative Ropes&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In 2003, Dr. Redberg spent a year in Washington, D.C. as a Robert Wood Johnson Health Policy Fellow. She and the other fellows spent several months meeting with key health care leaders in Washington and around the country, visiting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, state governments, private think tanks, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. &quot;It was a great year,&quot; said Dr. Redberg. &quot;In my continued policy work in the last 15 years, often the people I meet are those I first met as a Robert Wood Johnson fellow.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;As part of her fellowship, in January 2004 she began working as a health policy staff member for Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, who was the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee and a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, which oversees Medicare. Among other issues, she helped research and develop legislation related to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), implementation of the recently passed Medicare Modernization Act, and stem cell research. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;I learned a lot about how the sausage is made,&quot; said Dr. Redberg. &quot;One of the most educational but disappointing things was realizing that many patient advocacy groups weren’t representing patients. One of the first questions I always would ask is where their funding came from, and so often it came from industry.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;She also learned the nitty&#45;gritty of how legislation works, including the processes of rulemaking, appropriations and effective lobbying. For example, an FDA guidance is non&#45;binding, whereas a requirement is compulsory. Understanding those nuances has proven invaluable to her later work in national policy, such as serving as a member of the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, chairing the Medicare Evidence Development and Coverage Advisory Committee, and advising the FDA. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Redberg has a longstanding interest in policy around women and heart disease, which is the leading killer of women. Often, studies enroll few women, and investigators extrapolate their findings about drugs or devices from clinical trials that have mostly studied men. (The FDA currently has a guidance encouraging the inclusion of women in clinical trials, but not a requirement.) Yet women sometimes experience different side effects and outcomes in response to various drugs, and tend to bleed more from procedures and medications. She recalled one Medicare advisory committee meeting which was reviewing possible expansion of criteria for defibrillator placement. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;I noticed that the trial that was being presented as the basis for expansion had only 15 percent women, and it did not show any statistically significant benefit in women,&quot; said Dr. Redberg. &quot;When I asked the principal investigator why there weren’t more women, he told me that women didn’t get heart failure. That was a real shame, because the Medicare population is over 60 percent women, but we were being asked to approve this device on the basis of a study that had been done in mostly middle&#45;aged men.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Safety and Medical Devices&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;When Dr. Redberg returned from her Robert Wood Johnson Health Policy Fellowship, she focused much of her subsequent research on technology assessment and the evidence base and regulatory pathway for medical devices. &quot;Because I’m an academic, I have a very strong belief that the best way to weigh risks and benefits is to have good evidence,&quot; said Dr. Redberg. &quot;I have learned that we are often approving high&#45;risk devices on the basis of little and sometimes no clinical data.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Along with colleagues and the medical students and residents she mentors, Dr. Redberg has published extensively on this subject. &quot;We need stricter requirements for high quality data for safety and effectiveness of medical devices and drugs before they hit the market, and we also need to collect post&#45;market data,&quot; she said. The bar needs to be even higher for implantable devices which cannot be easily removed from patients without risk, she noted. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;I hear the word ‘innovation’ thrown around a lot, but you can’t really know if something is innovative unless you’ve done clinical testing,&quot; said Dr. Redberg. She and former UCSF resident Dr. Sanket Dhruva, who is now a Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholar at Yale University, co&#45;wrote a New York Times op&#45;ed piece critiquing the 21st Century Cures Act, a Congressional bill which would further weaken FDA oversight of new medical devices. That bill passed the House, and is currently in the Senate. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In another area of research, Dr. Redberg serves as principal investigator of the FAMRI Bland Lane Center of Excellence on Second Hand Smoke, which studies the long&#45;term effects of secondhand smoke on non&#45;smoking flight attendants. It is supported by the Flight Attendant Medical Research Institute. She and her colleagues have collected more than a decade of data about this group, which includes about 400 flight attendants who used to work in smoke&#45;filled airplane cabins. Study participants fill out an online survey, and can also come in to the Mission Bay clinic to undergo pulmonary testing. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Advancing the Conversation&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In 2009, Dr. Redberg became editor of JAMA Internal Medicine (formerly the Archives of Internal Medicine). That year, the US Preventive Services Task Force released new guidelines on mammography screening, recommending that women ages 50 to 74 have biennial screening, replacing its earlier guidelines recommending that women have mammograms every one to two years starting at age 40. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The new guidelines sought to minimize the large number of false positives which can lead to unnecessary biopsies and other invasive procedures, while maintaining the same benefits of regular screening. (Conducting mammograms every other year has been shown to produce the same benefit as screening annually in patients without a family history of breast cancer or other additional risk factors.) The new guidelines were controversial, and set off unfounded accusations of health care rationing. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;That backlash inspired a long conversation between Dr. Redberg and Dr. Deborah Grady, associate dean for Clinical and Translational Research. &quot;We talked about how the reaction to that very scientific and evidence&#45;based announcement was negative, and how we needed a whole public re&#45;education process,&quot; said Dr. Redberg. &quot;Right now, people think that if a little health care is good, then more health care is better, which is not always the case.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The two developed the idea for &quot;Less is More,&quot; an ongoing series in JAMA Internal Medicine; Dr. Grady serves as section editor. The articles highlight areas of health care with no known benefit, and definite harm. Several articles have prompted the FDA to issue warnings about faulty drugs and devices described in the series. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;One article by UCSF radiologist Dr. Rebecca Smith&#45;Bindman found that radiation doses for the same diagnostic test varied widely at four different Bay Area hospitals, and even within the same hospital on different days. &quot;That suggested that there was a lot of room for quality control, because everyone should be getting the lowest dose of radiation possible,&quot; said Dr. Redberg. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In the same issue, JAMA Internal Medicine published a study by researchers at the National Cancer Institute finding that from the computed tomography (CT) scans conducted in 2007, over the coming decades there will be about 29,000 excess cancers and 14,500 excess cancer deaths caused by the CT scans themselves. &quot;And that’s just from the CT scans done in 2007,&quot; said Dr. Redberg. &quot;While certainly some of these scans are life&#45;saving, there are a huge number of deaths from medical radiation. A lot of those CT scans probably didn’t need to be ordered.&quot; Dr. Smith&#45;Bindman testified in Congressional hearings held in response to the articles that JAMA Internal Medicine published on the subject. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In 2014, JAMA Internal Medicine also launched a series of perspectives called Teachable Moments, featuring articles by trainees that bring attention to the harms that can result from medical overuse, as well as from underuse of needed medical interventions. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;When we launched ‘Less is More,’ there were very few journals that were talking about the harms of medical care,&quot; said Dr. Redberg. &quot;All of our editors share a vision of moving the conversation forward. We select only the highest quality science, and appreciate being able to publish articles that get people thinking and talking.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In addition to her role as editor and her own extensive publications in scientific journals, Dr. Redberg is interviewed frequently by the lay press, and serves on a panel of health care experts for the Wall Street Journal, for which she regularly contributes blog posts. Some of her New York Times op&#45;ed pieces have been that publication’s most frequently emailed articles for days, and have generated hundreds of reader comments. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Training the Next Generation&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Redberg has been a leader in encouraging more women to become cardiologists. In 1994, she and Dr. Michael Crawford co&#45;founded an American Heart Association committee to increase the number of women entering the field, as well as the number of women in leadership positions. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;She has mentored many trainees, and shares a few key pieces of advice with them. &quot;It’s good to have a plan in mind, but to also be open to other ideas and opportunities that may come up,&quot; said Dr. Redberg. &quot;Also, always publish what you’ve done – it’s important to write and express your ideas.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;She and her husband, attorney David Larson, have two grown daughters, Anna and Rebecca. Dr. Redberg enjoys running and hiking, and does a wine country century bicycle ride each spring with her husband. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;As a heart failure and heart transplant specialist, faculty member Dr. Van Selby appreciates helping patients throughout all aspects of their treatment. &quot;I enjoy the interplay of seeing the patient in clinic, stabilizing them in the hospital, finding out exactly what is going on in their heart, and deciding the best treatment plan,&quot; he said.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
			Heart failure occurs when the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body’s needs, and affects more than 5 million Americans. In recent years, there have been many new developments to help patients. For example, UCSF Medical Center is a leading heart transplant center, and also offers the latest mechanical heart pumps, called ventricular assist devices (VADs). These can serve as a bridge to transplant, and in some cases provide long&#45;term therapy for patients who are ineligible for transplant. &quot;VADs are getting better and better, and it will be exciting to be in this field as they get even safer, less invasive and more effective,&quot; said Dr. Selby.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
			He enjoys working in the Cardiac Catheterization Lab, obtaining heart biopsies after a transplant to monitor for possible organ rejection and conducting right heart catheterizations to measure how well the heart is pumping blood. &quot;I like being in the cath lab, getting the numbers myself, taking the patient’s history into context, and revising my thinking as new information comes in,&quot; said Dr. Selby.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
			
			He also cares for patients with pulmonary hypertension, characterized by increased pressure in the arteries that carry blood from the heart to the lungs. Although there are similarities to heart failure, pulmonary hypertension has different causes and treatments. UCSF is a leading center for management of this relatively rare condition.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
			
			After majoring in economics at the University of Pennsylvania, Dr. Selby – who grew up in Berkeley – returned to the Bay Area and completed medical school, residency, and fellowships in cardiology and advanced heart failure, all at UCSF. As a heart failure fellow, he learned how to identify which patients could benefit from interventions beyond medical therapy, such as a VAD or heart transplant, and works collaboratively with patients to decide whether these options are right for them, given their individual values and goals. He also learned how to fine&#45;tune IV medications for heart failure patients in the intensive care unit to help stabilize them.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
			
			In addition to his clinical work, Dr. Selby spends about half of his time engaged in clinical research related to pulmonary hypertension and heart failure. He is involved with a multi&#45;institution collaboration to track outcomes for patients with amyloid cardiomyopathy, in which an abnormal protein builds up in heart tissue, limiting the heart’s ability to squeeze properly and sometimes contributing to abnormal heart rhythms. Patients with the condition usually deteriorate rapidly without intervention. He is helping lead UCSF’s participation in a large international trial of a new drug to treat amyloid cardiomyopathy; if effective, it would offer the first medical therapy for this disease.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
			
			He is also collaborating with the Health eHeart Study group, a UCSF initiative that has enrolled thousands of online volunteer participants and uses &quot;Big Data&quot; to improve the understanding and treatment of heart disease. Dr. Selby is part of the team which is piloting a small clinical trial of a new mobile app for participants with heart failure to see if it can help prevent unnecessary hospitalizations.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
			
			&quot;One of the reasons I wanted to stay at UCSF as a faculty member was because we offer a full spectrum of treatments,&quot; said Dr. Selby. &quot;Whatever they need, I can be there to help support the patients through it. I also appreciate the multidisciplinary team. We work very closely with the surgeons, nurses, pharmacists and physical therapists, guiding patients through the different stages of evaluation, surgery, post&#45;surgery management, and long&#45;term management. Each stage requires very different skills and approaches. Seeing the patient go from very sick, to getting the treatment they need and doing well long&#45;term is very satisfying.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
			
			In his free time, Dr. Selby enjoys spending time outdoors and hiking in the Sierras.
			&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Interventional cardiologist Dr. Krishan Soni’s grandfather died of a heart attack at 50, and his father had his first heart attack at 43. Dr. Soni, who recently joined the faculty, now helps many patients with similar conditions. He is also an emerging leader in quality, safety and value, working to improve care for all patients.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Growing up on Long Island, Dr. Soni knew he would become a doctor, but also wanted some broader experiences before plunging into a decade or more of medical training. After earning bachelor’s degrees in biochemistry and economics at Yale University, he worked in management consulting for two years in areas including finance, energy, advertising, mortgages and health care. &quot;It was extremely helpful, giving me skill sets for solving problems, analyzing large data sets, and presenting evidence in a compelling way,&quot; said Dr. Soni. &quot;During medical training, I was able to look at how systems issues impact the care we deliver.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;After earning his MD and MBA from Yale, he completed his internal medicine residency at UCSF, became the Department of Medicine’s first chief resident for quality improvement and patient safety, then completed fellowships in general cardiology and interventional cardiology.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;One big draw to UCSF was the Pathways to Discovery program, which provides longitudinal training in specialized areas. Dr. Soni chose the Health Systems and Leadership track, and in one project, worked with other residents to reduce &quot;door&#45;to&#45;floor&quot; time – the delay that emergency room patients face when waiting to be admitted to the hospital. &quot;We were able to use some of the tools I learned in business school, like queuing theory and operations research methodology, to understand the problem and develop solutions,&quot; said Dr. Soni.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;During fellowship, he developed and led implementation of a report template for cardiac catheterization patients which includes before&#45;and&#45;after pictures of their arteries and a short description in plain English. &quot;It helped patients better understand their disease and improved how we as doctors communicate with them,&quot; said Dr. Soni.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Improving Value&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Soni is excited by the Division of Cardiology’s recent work in improving outpatient care, led by Dr. Rajni Rao, and hopes to bring a similar focus to the inpatient setting. &quot;How do we reduce mortality, readmissions and delays, and improve patient satisfaction?&quot; asked Dr. Soni. &quot;There are a hundred things we could work on. At every single touch point for the patient, we’d like things to be safe, high quality and convenient for the patient.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;He was recently appointed as director of value improvement for the Department of Medicine&#45;UCSF Health Subspecialty Services, with a particular focus on improving value across all inpatient specialty practices within UCSF Health. These include cardiology, pulmonology, endocrinology, gastroenterology, rheumatology, nephrology and others.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;Over the past decade, we've come to learn that providing superb care to patients is not just a matter of smart and well trained clinicians – it also requires a system that works,&quot; said Dr. Robert M. Wachter, chair of the Department of Medicine, Holly Smith Distinguished Professor in Science and Medicine, and Marc and Lynne Benioff Endowed Chair. &quot;To build such a system, we need individuals who are skilled in both clinical medicine and in leadership and improvement science. Krishan Soni is ideally suited for this role, and I'm excited to work with him in our efforts to make care better and safer for our patients.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;Value is not just about decreasing costs,&quot; said Dr. Soni. &quot;It’s about delivering high&#45;quality, safe care to the appropriate patient at the appropriate time that creates good patient satisfaction, divided by the resources that go into that – including cost, time and people. We have to start prioritizing and think about what things are helpful, and what things are not – and may even be harmful. For example, unnecessary radiology studies expose patients to more radiation. We need to ask, ‘Is everything I’m doing going to help me understand the patient’s condition or treat them, and is it worth the side effects, risks and costs?’&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Some of the value improvement projects that he is currently shepherding include:&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Prevent rehospitalizations&lt;/i&gt;: Many hospitalized patients with cardiac conditions have complex needs, and need a checkup within a week or two of discharge. Unfortunately, some patients are unable to get a timely appointment to see a cardiologist or internist, and may end up back in the hospital for preventable complications. Dr. Soni, Dr. Rao and their nursing colleagues created a pilot Cardiology Outpatient Recovery (COR) clinic, which assigned a nurse practitioner to meet with patients while they were still hospitalized. She helped develop discharge plans, and scheduled follow&#45;up appointments before they were discharged or within three days of them leaving the hospital. She then saw most patients within two weeks, when problems often start brewing. Dr. Soni and the team are evaluating whether the clinic helps prevent unnecessary rehospitalizations and improves patients’ health outcomes.
			
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Appropriate testing&lt;/i&gt;: One of the most commonly ordered tests in hospitals is troponin, which can indicate whether a patient has suffered a heart attack. Dr. Soni worked with Dr. Leila Yeh Beach, an internal medicine resident, who found that about one in three troponin tests at UCSF were ordered for conditions that were very unlikely to be a heart attack. &quot;A lot of folks say, ‘Just get the test – that way we won’t miss a heart attack,’ said Dr. Soni. Unfortunately, the troponin test has many &quot;false positives,&quot; which can lead physicians to order additional tests and procedures that carry additional risks without necessarily benefitting the patient.
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;For example, a patient came to the Emergency Department complaining of abdominal pain; his history and exam suggested that he had gallstones. However, his troponin test was positive, so he underwent several more tests before cardiologists ruled out a heart attack and finally cleared him to go to the operating room to have his gallstones removed. &quot;In that case, I would define value as finding the gallstones, treating them, and making the patient feel better with a CT scan, an exam and surgery,&quot; said Dr. Soni. &quot;Asking the patient to run on a treadmill and delaying treatment of his primary diagnosis by a few days likely added little value to his care.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reduce patient wait times&lt;/i&gt;: Dr. Soni is guiding team&#45;driven workflow improvements to reduce the number of days a patient must wait to have procedures such as heart catheterization procedures and other cardiac studies. At the actual appointment, Dr. Soni and his colleagues want to reduce time that patients waste waiting to meet with doctors and have their procedures. &quot;Some procedures only last 30 minutes, but the patient may spend six or eight hours here,&quot; he said.
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Using Lean management techniques – a continuous process improvement model originally developed by Toyota – Dr. Soni brings together faculty and staff to map out every step of a procedure, from scheduling to the appointment to the follow&#45;up call. &quot;We ask everyone, ‘What do you do every day, where do things not work, and what ideas do you have for improving the work?’&quot; he said. &quot;This isn’t something I could do just sitting in my office. To be honest, I don’t know what a nurse does when he or she is preparing a patient for a procedure, so I’m the last person to say how to make it better. I want to encourage the team to come up with great ideas, then empower them to make changes. A lot of this is experimentation – you have an idea, try it, and see if it works. We’re constantly measuring and improving.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Improving access to stress tests&lt;/i&gt;: Using the above approach, Dr. Rao and her colleagues identified bottlenecks in cardiac stress tests for clinic patients. By eliminating inefficient processes and optimizing workflow, they were able to increase the number of stress test appointment slots from three to four per day.
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;On the inpatient side, UCSF Medical Center and the Division of Cardiology established a Clinical Decision Unit (CDU) a few years ago for patients who come to the Emergency Department with chest pain who are at low likelihood of having severe heart disease. Rather than admit these patients to the cardiology service, these patients stay in an area near the Emergency Department for observation, receive an expedited workup – including a stress test, if needed – and if everything looks fine, are able to go home without being admitted. Patients cannot stay more than 24 hours in the CDU, so if they are unable to get a stress test within that time, they are usually admitted to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;A team of nurse practitioners in the Heart and Vascular Stress Lab led an interdepartmental collaboration to educate the CDU team on choosing the most appropriate type of stress test for each patient. They also worked with their colleagues to adjust the stress lab’s scheduling to help accommodate CDU patients within the 24&#45;hour window. &quot;Simple things like that can vastly improve access,&quot; said Dr. Soni. &quot;It also helps prevent having healthy people in hospital beds while sick people are waiting in the Emergency Department.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Interventional Advances&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In addition to thinking about the big picture, Dr. Soni enjoys the hands&#45;on work of interventional cardiology. &quot;We can fix anatomic issues, and because of improved technology, we can do things we weren’t able to offer ten years ago,&quot; he said. For example, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) allows some patients to receive a replacement valve without undergoing open&#45;heart surgery. Instead, interventional cardiologists insert a replacement valve through a catheter inserted in the groin and thread it up into the heart.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;There are also new ways to treat chronic total occlusions (CTOs) – complete blockages of the artery which used to require bypass surgery. &quot;It’s like having a sink drain that is 100 percent blocked – you can’t put anything down the sink to unclog it,&quot; said Dr. Soni. However, new techniques allow interventional cardiologists to carefully insert a wire into the artery wall, creating a tunnel in which a balloon can be inflated to open up the blocked area. &quot;The artery wall stretches,&quot; said Dr. Soni. &quot;It’s riskier than a standard stent procedure, but this is a potential alternative for patients who are not surgical candidates.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Similarly, heart failure patients were historically not good candidates for stents, because their hearts might be unable to pump enough blood during the procedure. They usually undergo bypass surgery, where a cardiac surgeon can stop the heart and temporarily put them on an external heart pump. Now interventional cardiologists can temporarily insert an Impella – a miniaturized left ventricular device (LVAD) which is inserted through the groin and up into the heart. It helps pump blood during the procedure, then is removed. &quot;Patients go home within a couple of days, rather than spending a week in the hospital,&quot; said Dr. Soni.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Soni appreciates making a difference in patients’ lives. &quot;When I can reassure someone who is worried or provide them with medical or interventional therapy to help them feel better, it’s very rewarding,&quot; he said. He also enjoys teaching trainees about cardiology and engaging them in quality improvement projects. &quot;At UCSF, we attract bright, very motivated people at all levels of training,&quot; said Dr. Soni. &quot;It’s really fun to see how excited they get about learning, and helping to shape how they think about problems.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Outside of medicine, Dr. Soni is a model railroad fan and a stamp collector. He is married to Ahn Jiwajinda, who works at UCSF on quality improvement in areas such as information technology and human resources. Together they have a young daughter, Olivia.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/ucsfhealthcardiology.ucsf.edu/files/images/springer&#45;lab&#45;p.jpg&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; style=&quot;width:710px;&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Springer lab. &lt;i&gt;Photo credit: Suzaynn Schick, PhD.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;br /&gt;
			
			
			
			
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;
			Dr. Matthew Springer, an expert in the effects of secondhand smoke, was at Paul McCartney’s concert in AT&amp;T Park in 2010 when a cloud of smoke wafted over the audience. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;He was surprised, because people generally refrain from smoking in public spaces like the ballpark. Then Dr. Springer realized it was marijuana. &quot;Paul McCartney stopped between songs and said, ‘There’s something in the air – it must be San Francisco,’&quot; he recalled with a laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Springer, who holds a PhD in biological sciences and has been on the UCSF faculty since 2003, realized that people who avoid tobacco smoke may think that marijuana secondhand smoke is natural or medicinal, and therefore harmless. But there is actually very little research about the health effects of marijuana secondhand smoke.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Spurred by a desire to help policymakers and the public make informed decisions as marijuana becomes legal in more communities, Dr. Springer began a new avenue of investigation. Using the same techniques that he has used to study secondhand tobacco smoke, his lab found that rats that are exposed to secondhand marijuana smoke for one minute experience a substantial decrease in the ability of blood vessels to expand and carry more blood. This ability, called flow&#45;mediated vasodilation (FMD), is important – for example, it allows someone who is exercising to send more oxygen to their muscles.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;It has been known for many years that FMD is impaired by smoking tobacco. Several research groups, including some at UCSF, have shown that humans exposed to 30 minutes of secondhand tobacco smoke have temporarily impaired FMD. After a couple of hours, their blood vessels recover. However, people who are frequently exposed to tobacco secondhand smoke, such as family members of smokers, have the blood vessels of smokers: repeated exposure to secondhand smoke produces a long&#45;term effect.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In a paper recently published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, Dr. Springer’s latest research found that rats exposed to as little as one minute of secondhand smoke – whether it was from tobacco or marijuana – experienced FMD impairment. Interestingly, while the rats’ blood vessels recovered within 30 minutes of exposure to tobacco secondhand smoke, the impairment lasted at least 90 minutes after they had been exposed to marijuana secondhand smoke. &quot;This is way worse than what we see with tobacco [secondhand smoke],&quot; said Dr. Springer. &quot;That was pretty astounding, and we said, ‘People need to know about this.’&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Informing the Public Debate&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;As a pioneer in the study of how marijuana secondhand smoke affects cardiovascular function, Dr. Springer has taken the initiative to share his discoveries with policymakers who are deciding how to regulate marijuana use in public spaces. So far, he has provided information about his findings to aides to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, Alameda County Board of Supervisors, and Burlingame City Council, as well as the Anchorage Assembly in Alaska, the mayor and council of Washington, DC, and the premier and associate health minister of Ontario, Canada. He has also published letters to the editor in the Washington Post, the Toronto Star, and the Denver Post, and sent a policy briefing to Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom's Blue Ribbon Commission on Marijuana Policy. Dr. Springer has also been interviewed on the topic by KCBS Radio, KGO Radio, Fox News and CBS News, among other media outlets.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Springer has set up an automated Google search for marijuana secondhand smoke to alert him to local debates on the topic. &quot;Some people want to allow marijuana smoking in places where tobacco smoking is not allowed, and someone always brings up the statement, ‘There is no scientific evidence that marijuana smoke is harmful,’&quot; he said. &quot;Whenever we see that, we zip in and say, ‘Wait a minute, we’ve found some evidence that marijuana smoke is not necessarily harmless, so please rethink your basic premise.’&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Most recently, aides to California Assemblymember Jim Wood, D&#45;Healdsburg, contacted Dr. Springer to obtain a statement regarding AB 2300, a medical marijuana bill that allows landlords to prohibit smoking of marijuana – even medical marijuana – in rental properties where tobacco smoking is banned. The bill is primarily aimed at the transfer of smoke from one home to another in multi&#45;unit housing. AB 2300 passed the California Assembly 77&#45;0 in May, passed the Senate Judiciary Committee 7&#45;0 in June, and is scheduled to be voted on by the full Senate later this summer. &quot;Our initially reported marijuana results were cited as one of the reasons that Assemblymember Wood wrote this bill,&quot; said Dr. Springer. &quot;This is a good example of how this kind of work can influence public health policy.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Dr. Springer’s lab found that even in marijuana which had been treated to remove THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol – the compound which produces the &quot;high&quot; in users – the secondhand smoke produced the same adverse effects on blood vessels. &quot;This is not a marijuana drug effect, this was a marijuana smoke effect,&quot; he said. &quot;Which makes sense, because cigarette smoke does it, too.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Another important point is that most previous studies have investigated whether there is a link between marijuana secondhand smoke and lung cancer or lung function, with mixed results. Dr. Springer’s research focuses on cardiovascular function, demonstrating a clear&#45;cut physiological effect in a rat model. &quot;The vast majority of deaths caused by secondhand tobacco smoke are thought to be from cardiovascular disease, not lung cancer,&quot; he said. Finding a link between marijuana secondhand smoke and adverse cardiovascular effects is therefore something that merits attention and further study.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Springer said he intentionally remains agnostic on whether marijuana should be legalized. &quot;I don’t want to come across as having a pro&#45; or anti&#45;legalization agenda,&quot; he said. &quot;But if people are going to smoke marijuana and other people are exposed to that smoke, we have to look at that as if it were tobacco secondhand smoke.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;He is also interested in studying whether multiple short exposures to marijuana can lead to long&#45;term impairments, similar to the effects of tobacco secondhand smoke. Yet another interest is whether smoking marijuana using a vaporizer would allow people to avoid blood vessel impairment.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Challenges and Rewards&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Conducting this research in marijuana posed more obstacles than his research on tobacco secondhand smoke. Marijuana is a Schedule 1 controlled substance, and using it for research required approvals from the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the State of California, and the UC police. Securing these approvals took about a year, which was a little ironic given that Dr. Springer’s Parnassus lab is a short walk from Haight Street and Golden Gate Park.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;I told the DEA agent, ‘You know, just down the hill is the place where you have to tell people, ‘I’m sorry, I don’t want to buy your marijuana,’&quot; Dr. Springer recalled ruefully. &quot;It was then that I found out that you really shouldn’t joke with DEA agents.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Despite the particular challenges of his investigations, Dr. Springer is excited to conduct research that could have such immediate applications. &quot;As a non&#45;clinician in a clinical division, it is great to be involved in something with a defined public health benefit,&quot; he said. &quot;As cardiologists, my colleagues are curing patients or getting them to change their lifestyles. I love this [marijuana] project, because by demonstrating things that people don’t already know, if people change their behavior and avoid combustion products that could be causing them decreased health, we’ve actually had a direct effect on the health of individuals.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Improving Treatment for Heart Attacks&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin&#45;left:10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/ucsfhealthcardiology.ucsf.edu/files/images/springer&#45;lab.jpg&quot; class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Springer lab equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;In addition to his research on secondhand smoke, Dr. Springer has spent years investigating the use of cell therapy as a possible therapeutic agent for survivors of heart attacks. After a heart attack, some heart cells die right away and turns into scar tissue, some survive, and some teeter between survival and death.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Springer’s lab and other research groups have shown that in rodent models, giving mice that survive a heart attack some cells derived from the bone marrow can help these at&#45;risk heart cells to survive, thereby minimizing the extent of the scar tissue. He hypothesizes that this cell therapy works due to a paracrine effect –the implanted bone marrow cells produce yet&#45;to&#45;be identified factors that enhance the preservation of tissue.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;However, attempts to use this approach in humans in clinical trials did not work as well as it did in rodents. Dr. Springer’s research found the likely reason why. The animals in typical rodent cell therapy experiments have been genetically identical, so researchers have harvested cells from young, healthy donor mice and implanted them into the mice which had suffered heart attacks. However, humans need to receive their own cells to avoid the risk of rejection by the immune system. Participants in the clinical trials received their own bone marrow cells that were harvested after they had a heart attack. &quot;We think inflammation develops because of the heart attack, which changes the composition of the bone marrow,&quot; said Dr. Springer. &quot;It’s different than if they were receiving bone marrow cells from young, healthy people.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;His lab is currently trying to figure out ways to successfully use donor cells from older mice or those that have already undergone a heart attack, in the hopes that such an approach could also be used in humans.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Earthquakes and Music&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In addition to having a broad range of scientific pursuits, Dr. Springer has an eclectic mix of other interests. He is passionate about earthquake preparedness, spawned in part by his own experience of several California temblors. His father was a physics professor at the University of Southern California, so Dr. Springer was in the Sylmar earthquake of 1971 as a child. In 1989, Dr. Springer was earning his PhD at Stanford during the Loma Prieta quake. He also grew up in Northridge; although he was living in the Bay Area by the time the 1994 Northridge earthquake struck, his family was greatly affected by it. 
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;I have learned from experience and have a decently well&#45;arranged home for earthquake safety,&quot; said Dr. Springer. &quot;Around 2007, I was thinking that we are recruiting people from other parts of the country and the world to work with us in our labs, and it would be nice to give them some hints on how to live in California. Just like if you’re in New York City, you probably tell new recruits not to go jogging in Central Park at two in the morning by themselves. I thought, I should at least warn people not to hang a heavy picture over their bed because we have earthquakes.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Springer made a presentation to his lab, and then to the Division of Cardiology. He now gives these earthquake safety lectures at several UCSF campuses as well as branches of the San Francisco Public Library – about 10 to 15 talks annually. He also writes the &lt;a href=&quot;http://quaketips.blogspot.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Quaketips&lt;/a&gt; blog, which receives about 6,000 page views each month, and has been interviewed several times by local media on earthquake preparedness.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;To me, a professor in a clinical division is not just someone who teaches people who come to him or her,&quot; said Dr. Springer. &quot;Such a professor serves a role in public. If I can impact public health by educating people about precautions they can take to prevent them from being injured or perhaps killed in the next big earthquake, or perhaps by getting them to avoid marijuana secondhand smoke for that matter, then I can feel that the ‘Professor of Medicine’ title actually is valid.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Springer is also an avid musician. He plays the violin, piano, various percussion instruments, and erhu – the Chinese violin. He has played violin and percussion with the Peninsula Symphony Orchestra since 1999, and spends every Tuesday night in rehearsal.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;You’ve got to feed both halves of your brain or your soul,&quot; he said. &quot;Science is cerebral, and music isn’t. There is a lot more feeling in the music that you just can’t do in science.&quot; About 15 years ago, he suffered from tendonitis and had to stop playing for about six months. &quot;Without the music, life went from being in color to being in black and white,&quot; said Dr. Springer. &quot;You go to work, you do the research, but there was a dimension that just wasn’t there. For other people it’s baseball or whatever, but this is my own personal necessity.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;He also appreciates how playing an instrument can counterbalance the often glacial pace of scientific research. &quot;In science, you can go for months without seeing any progress,&quot; said Dr. Springer. &quot;Whereas when I sit down and practice my music, I’m better after practice. How cool is that?&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Finding a Niche&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Springer said his career trajectory has shifted from pure basic science – his graduate work examined developmental gene regulation in a bread mold – to more applied or translational science. &quot;I have only the utmost respect for people who do the pure basic research,&quot; he said. &quot;I just needed, for my own satisfaction, to see a stronger link to helping people…. It’s good to find where you feel the most reward, and gravitate towards that.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;His lab attracts trainees from around the world, including researchers from China and Iran; many are so motivated to work with him that they are willing to self&#45;fund their positions, though Dr. Springer does try to help them secure fellowships.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;I will forever be grateful to the Cardiology Division for bringing me on,&quot; said Dr. Springer. &quot;Being in a clinical division opened up possibilities that were not accessible to me when I was in a basic department. The level of moral support is very good here.&quot;
			&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Heartfelt Listening&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes the most profound thing we can do for patients is just to listen,” said Dr. Anne Thorson, associate director of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cardiology.ucsf.edu/care/clinical/vascular.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;UCSF Center for Prevention of Heart and Vascular Disease&lt;/a&gt;.
			“It becomes a therapeutic relationship where they feel heard and cared for. And if you listen well, the patient will almost always give you enough information to make the diagnosis.”
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;She recalled meeting a hospitalized patient with heart failure who was in agonizing pain and was unable to walk. The hospital resident had an iPad with all of the patient’s data on it, but hadn’t actually examined the patient. From talking with the family, Dr. Thorson found out that the patient’s severe back pain had only developed while she was in the hospital, and ordered imaging of her back which revealed a life&#45;threatening spinal abscess that required emergency surgery.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“I took the resident aside and said, ‘You need to put that iPad down, and go in, talk to the patient and examine her,’” said Dr. Thorson. “It took me all of three minutes to find out that there was something terribly wrong. Rather than getting caught up in the technology, we need to go in and listen.”
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt; Dr. Thorson is a full&#45;time clinician specializing in preventive cardiology and women’s heart health. She sees clinic patients at 1 Daniel Burnham Court and the UCSF National Center of Excellence in Women’s Health at Mount Zion, and spends about one week a month caring for inpatients at Moffitt&#45;Long Hospital on the Parnassus campus.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Whether she sees her patients in the hospital or clinic, she loves hearing about their lives. “I’ve met some really fascinating, amazing patients who have been through a lot of really interesting things,” she said. “Listening to their stories also helps me understand why they might not want to do something I want them to do.”
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;For example, patients often balk at taking a statin. “I say to them, ‘But your grandfather, father and brother have all had heart attacks, and your cholesterol is high,’” said Dr. Thorson. “I explain how the drug works and the reasons why I want them to take it. If we run into a side effect, we discuss how we can always stop that drug and try another. The old days where a doctor just said, ‘Take this pill and don’t ask me any questions’ are over. The move now is to more collaboration between patients and providers, and less paternalism – which I think is a good thing.” &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h4&gt;&lt;u&gt;Preventing Heart Disease&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Thorson grew up near Seattle, where her father was a pathologist. She remembers climbing into his lap and looking at pathology slides together. “From a young age, I thought, ‘Boy, this is what I want to do when I grow up!’ she said.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Thorson graduated from Stanford University with a bachelor’s degree in Human Biology. She worked as a researcher at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and earned a master’s degree in physiology from Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. before deciding to return to Stanford for medical school.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Thorson planned to become an obstetrician&#45;gynecologist, but as an internal medicine intern at California Pacific Medical Center (CPMC) in San Francisco, she took care of a heart transplant recipient. “It transformed her life completely,” said Dr. Thorson. “Her heart was so bad that she couldn’t walk across the room. A few months after the transplant, she sent me a postcard from the Alps, where she was hiking with her family. I thought, this is what I want to do!”
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Thorson completed her internal medicine residency and cardiology fellowship at CPMC, where she then became a clinical cardiologist. While her initial inspiration was heart transplant, her true passions led her in another direction.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“About 75 percent of heart disease could be completely prevented if we could get people to adopt healthier lifestyle strategies,” said Dr. Thorson. “There’s always going to be a genetic component to heart disease, but the remaining factors are things we can alter through diet, lifestyle, weight loss, stress reduction, controlling high blood pressure and helping people to lose weight.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“Those things sound very simple, but getting people to actually do them is not so simple,” said Dr. Thorson. “I spend a lot of my day working with people to implement these lifestyle strategies to reduce their risk of developing heart disease, or if they’ve already had a heart attack or stroke, to prevent the second one.”
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;For example, she served as the medical director of CPMC’s cardiac rehabilitation program, and later for the UCSF Heart Disease Reversal Program, which included a team of cardiac nurse specialists and a dietician who helped patients develop a monitored exercise program and a heart healthy diet. At group sessions, she educated participants about things such as cholesterol levels and warning signs of a stroke, and patients shared information and experiences with each another.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt; “I just got a letter from a group of patients from 20 years ago,” said Dr. Thorson. “They still get together for group meetings, and adhere to those lifestyle changes. They want me to come to their 20 year reunion. These were high&#45;risk patients – all of them had been referred for a cardiac bypass or stent, but elected to try lifestyle changes instead. Often, in situations like that, there’s a window of opportunity, because people are very motivated to change.”
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Thorson joined the UCSF faculty in 1999, and is excited to be working with her colleagues on developing a comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation program at UCSF – one that will likely include exercise, group meals and nutrition education, a support group and yoga or other forms of stress reduction.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“While everyone agrees that prevention is a great idea, until recently insurance programs have not been very willing to pay for them,” said Dr. Thorson. “But now there is growing recognition that it’s a lot cheaper to pay for cardiac rehab than for someone’s seventh stent.”
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h4&gt;&lt;u&gt;Start with Exercise&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;While patients can do many things to reduce their risk of heart disease, Dr. Thorson said exercise is an excellent starting place. “Exercise helps reduce blood pressure, control blood sugar, and keep weight stable, and it also reduces stress and helps people sleep better,” she said. “It impacts everything else, and you get a lot of bang for your buck.”
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;National guidelines recommend at least &lt;a href=&quot;https://health.gov/paguidelines/guidelines/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;150 minutes of moderate&#45;intensity physical activity each week&lt;/a&gt; – 30 minutes five days a week – as well as muscle&#45;strengthening activities such as lifting weights at least twice a week. Yet less than one in four Americans meet these recommendations. “We are becoming a nation that is much more physically inactive,” said Dr. Thorson.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;She takes a pragmatic approach, working with patients to develop concrete exercise plans. Dr. Thorson asks about their day – when they get up, how they get to work, what their other commitments are. If they drive to work, she suggests parking 10 minutes away from work. “Then they have a brisk 10&#45;minute walk to work, a 10&#45;minute walk back to their car at the end of the day, and then all they have to do is 10 minutes around the block or up and down the stairs during lunchtime,” she said. “Then they’ve got their 30 minutes. It needs to actually fit into their day, and it’s different for everybody.”
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;For patients who have trouble walking, she recommends the PBS program, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sitandbefit.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sit and Be Fit&lt;/a&gt;,” which includes chair exercises. People with joint problems could take a pool exercise class. “There are ways to work around challenges, and exercise physiologists are especially helpful for people who can’t walk or do the usual activities,” said Dr. Thorson.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Exercise doesn’t require fancy gear or an expensive gym membership. “I’ve told people that they don’t need to buy weights,” said Dr. Thorson. “Just get a couple of one&#45;liter bottles of water, and when you’re sitting in front of the TV, you can lift 2.2 pounds with each hand. You have to adapt to real life and what people can do.”
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h4&gt;&lt;u&gt;Women’s Heart Health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Thorson’s other passion is improving women’s heart health. While many women worry about developing breast cancer, the leading killer of women is cardiovascular disease. “We still have a long way to go to educate women about what puts them at risk, what symptoms they would be aware of, and when they need to see a doctor,” she said.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Thorson recently began seeing patients at the UCSF National Center of Excellence in Women’s Health at Mount Zion to provide expert cardiac care to this population. There are subtle gender differences in the way heart disease manifests and how it is best treated. For example, systolic heart failure affect the heart’s ability to pump effectively. However, in diastolic heart failure, the pumping function is normal, but the heart has trouble relaxing in between squeezes. This condition is more common in women than in men for reasons not yet understood.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Women are also more likely to have bleeding complications from blood thinners. “Often it’s the same recommended dose for a 220 pound man as for a 100 pound woman, but there’s been some recent discussion about whether these drugs should be based on weight and gender,” said Dr. Thorson. “We need more evidence&#45;based data for women, because they are underrepresented in most studies, and we have historically just extrapolated from studies that are heavily male&#45;populated.” To help correct this imbalance, she particularly encourages her women patients to enroll in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Women are also at higher risk for developing spontaneous dissections of their coronary arteries – when one of the vessels that feeds the heart itself develops a tear in its wall, and blood flows in between the layers of the artery. This potentially fatal condition can cause a heart attack, and more frequently affects younger women, particularly during pregnancy and around birth.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Thorson is particularly interested in the research of her colleague, cardiologist &lt;a href=&quot;https://cardiology.ucsf.edu/facstaff/spotlight/parikh.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dr. Nisha Parikh&lt;/a&gt;, on developing better ways to monitor the heart health of expectant mothers. “It appears that pregnancy is really the first ‘stress test’ that many women have, and if they develop high blood pressure or diabetes during pregnancy, that may indicate that their blood vessels are primed to develop cardiovascular disease later in life,” said Dr. Thorson.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, many such patients fall off the radar once they give birth, since their obstetrician&#45;gynecologist may be the only physician they see when they are young and seemingly healthy. “By the time they finally see a general medicine doctor, they may discover that they have full&#45;blown diabetes or high blood pressure, and we wonder, how long has this been going on?” said Dr. Thorson.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The UCSF investigators are studying whether getting patients who develop gestational diabetes or preeclampsia – high blood pressure during pregnancy – into surveillance programs can help physicians intervene early if their blood sugar or blood pressure become abnormal, hopefully preventing later heart disease. “We also wonder if we could identify some biomarker that could tell us if a patient is at risk of blood vessel issues, and whether we could intervene earlier, while they are pregnant or even before?” said Dr. Thorson.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;On the positive side, women whose hearts are dyssynchronous – where the right and left sides squeeze at different times, rather than simultaneously – can benefit from cardiac resynchronization therapy, which utilizes a specialized pacemaker. “Women actually experience better overall survival and show a higher degree of improvements in their heart function compared with men,” said Dr. Thorson.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h4&gt;&lt;u&gt;Teachable Moments&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;For many years, Dr. Thorson served as supervising cardiologist in the cardiovascular stress laboratory, where her team measured the heart health of patients exercising on a treadmill. “I got a master’s degree in physiology, and the cardiac stress lab is physiology in action,” she said. Dr. Thorson challenges trainees to predict exactly where a particular coronary blockage will be, based on everything they know from the patient history, exam and diagnostic tests – and whether they think the patient will need bypass surgery or a stent. “Afterwards, we loop back and see how right we were, to hone our skills,” she said.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Thorson relishes working with trainees. “The interns, residents and fellows at UCSF are so bright, and their enthusiasm is contagious,” she said. “They’ll ask me a question, and I’ll say, ‘Whoa, I don’t know,’ and that will prompt me to look it up – and then we’ll regroup and all learn.”
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Recently, Dr. Thorson received an email from Dr. Kelly Guld, who completed her general cardiology fellowship at UCSF in 2017 and joined a prestigious private practice in Arizona. “The email said, ‘I just wanted to tell you that I made my first diagnosis as an attending of constrictive pericarditis,’ ” said Dr. Thorson, referring to a condition in which the sac&#45;like covering of the heart is chronically inflamed, accompanied by thickening and scarring. Dr. Guld went on to mention that she and Dr. Thorson had encountered three or four cases of constrictive pericarditis in their work together, and Dr. Thorson had helped Dr. Guld learn how to diagnose and treat the condition. “That email just made my year – to know that she’s doing well and feels like she’s well trained,” said Dr. Thorson.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In addition to inspiring generations of trainees, Dr. Thorson also is widely respected among her colleagues. “I have had the privilege of working with Dr. Anne Thorson since she joined our UCSF Cardiology Division faculty nearly 20 years ago,” said Dr. William Grossman, Charles and Helen Schwab Endowed Chair in Preventive Cardiology and director of the Center for Prevention of Heart and Vascular Disease. “She is an outstanding physician, devoted to her patients, and dedicated to her particular area of interest and expertise, prevention and women’s health.”
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“She is truly masterful in her ability to synthesize clinical information, intuit and elucidate a patient’s inner feelings, fears, reservations, and concerns, thoughtfully order the exact test that is needed to clinch a diagnosis without a senseless battery of orders, and adroitly obtain consensus,” said Cardiology Clinic Practice Chief Dr. Rajni Rao. “She treats all patients with the utmost respect, earning her a legendary reputation as the ‘patron saint’ of cardiology. Her patients each have a story to tell of how she made a diagnosis when others couldn’t, of how she heard them when others dismissed their complaints, or of how she started with one patient and now cares for an entire family.”
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;UCSF Health recently bestowed a Great Experience Award on Dr. Thorson, which recognizes individuals or teams who have gone above and beyond to create an exceptional experience for patients, families or colleagues.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Thorson is married to Peter Ross, an investment banker. Together they have a grown daughter, Katie, who plans to pursue a doctorate in health psychology. Dr. Thorson practices what she preaches, waking at 5:30 each weekday to work out on the treadmill, elliptical trainer or stair climber. She also does Pilates and yoga several times a week, and enjoys hiking, biking, playing with her two dogs and reading biographies.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&#45; Elizabeth Chur&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Cardiologist Dr. Geoffrey Tison combines two of his passions – preventive medicine and technological innovation – to improve health in new ways.
			
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We collect so much health&#45;related information – including through the electronic medical record and increasingly through devices that sense physiologic signals – but the majority of this data is not used in an integrated way,&quot; said Dr. Tison. &quot;My vision is to develop novel analytic techniques to assimilate existing health information with newer types of data, such as from sensors, to provide a global, real&#45;time picture of health&#45;status – and then to deploy this technology through large networks of health care institutions to support widespread prevention.&quot;
			
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tison graduated from Brown University with a bachelor’s degree in neuroscience, then earned his master of public health and medical degrees from Johns Hopkins University. At UCSF, he completed fellowships in general cardiology, advanced echocardiography, preventive cardiology and digital cardiology. 
			
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;All my research has been prevention&#45;related,&quot; he said. &quot;It’s a philosophy as well as a clinical discipline: prevent before treating, at every stage of disease.&quot; That includes keeping people healthy, preventing heart disease from worsening, and stabilizing patients so they can stay out of the hospital.
			
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a clinician, Dr. Tison cares for hospitalized patients and performs both noninvasive and invasive echocardiograms, which are ultrasounds of the heart. As much as he enjoys helping individual patients, he believes that technology can help him make a broader impact. &quot;Perhaps technology’s greatest potential is its inherent scalability, which can allow us to help millions of people at a time,&quot; he said.
			
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, for decades cardiologists have measured how far patients with heart failure can walk within six minutes to assess disease severity and prognosis. UCSF researchers recently created a &lt;a href=&quot;http://circheartfailure.ahajournals.org/content/8/5/905.long&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;smartphone app allowing patients to perform this test at home&lt;/a&gt;, enabling longitudinal remote measurements. Dr. Tison developed a &quot;computable phenotype,&quot; which is an algorithm that can identify patients with heart failure, within the National Patient&#45;Centered Clinical Research Network (&lt;a href=&quot;http://PCORnet.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PCORnet&lt;/a&gt;), a nationwide network of health care institutions that combines de&#45;identified medical records from millions of patients. Using this computable phenotype, he will invite heart failure patients to regularly measure their six&#45;minute walk test using the smartphone app. 
			
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If we find that the smartphone&#45;based six&#45;minute walk test helps prevent recurrent hospitalizations, we could offer it to all heart failure patients throughout PCORnet, which would be a larger&#45;scale prevention effort than anything done previously,&quot; he said. &quot;That’s an example of combining new sensor data with the broad scale that’s achievable through a large network.&quot;
			
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;My other focus area is applying machine learning to medicine,&quot; said Dr. Tison. &quot;There are countless opportunities for the thoughtful application of machine learning to improve clinical medicine.&quot; Presently, Dr. Tison employs deep neural networks – sophisticated pattern recognition algorithms – to improve interpretation of electrocardiograms, and he is also applying these techniques to interpret longitudinal health record data. 
			
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Geoff is part of a new breed of researchers that applies novel analytic skills to problems in cardiology,&quot; said Dr. Jeffrey Olgin, chief of the Division of Cardiology, Gallo&#45;Chatterjee Distinguished Professor of Medicine, and co&#45;principal investigator of the Health eHeart Study. &quot;In this era of ‘big data,’ there are few researchers – and even fewer in cardiology – who have these skills; most are employed by companies like Google. Geoff will help our Division use new data analyses to advance both scientific discovery and patient care.&quot;
			 
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;No single device or innovation will transform medicine, but there’s huge potential to combine the technological innovations in sensors, machine learning and health data networks to impact medicine,&quot; said Dr. Tison. &quot;I can’t imagine a better time or place to be, because of the Division of Cardiology’s support of innovative research and our proximity to Silicon Valley.&quot;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Aside from medicine, Dr. Tison enjoys skiing, cycling and playing the ukulele.&lt;/p&gt;

Faculty Spotlight: Dr. Kirsten Tolstrup ./cardiology/facstaff/spotlight/tolstrup.html
		</Fname>
		<Tax>1736</Tax>
		<Path>./cardiology/facstaff/spotlight/tolstrup.html</Path>
		<FileBody>
			
			&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/ucsfhealthcardiology.ucsf.edu/files/images/tolstrup.jpg&quot; class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Photo credit: Elisabeth Fall&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Putting Patients First&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt; Echocardiologist Kirsten Tolstrup was born in Denmark and earned her medical degree from the University of Copenhagen. During medical school, she came to the United States to visit her brother, a wind power machinist who was working in California. “I spent six weeks in Palm Springs around Christmastime, and I was sold – I loved the warm weather!” recalled Dr. Tolstrup. After completing internships at hospitals in Denmark, she completed her internal medicine residency at the University of Southern California and her cardiology fellowship at the University of New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I really liked cardiology because with just a patient history, physical, stethoscope and your hands, you can often obtain a diagnosis,&amp;rdquo; said Dr. Tolstrup. &amp;ldquo;And with echocardiography, you can use a non&#45;invasive diagnostic tool that has no risk to the patients.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;One of her fellowship mentors was Dr. Michael Crawford, who is now the Lucie Stern Professor of Cardiology at UCSF. He recommended her for a job at Cedars&#45;Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, one of the highest volume echo labs in the country. She worked there for the next 11 years, eventually directing the Cardiac Non&#45;Invasive Stress Laboratory and becoming associate professor of medicine at UCLA School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I was mentored by some amazing people at Cedars&#45;Sinai,&amp;rdquo; said Dr. Tolstrup. &amp;ldquo;They taught me that patients come first. They demonstrated the value of providing great customer service &amp;ndash; even if it requires jumping through hoops.&amp;rdquo; Her mentors also demonstrated the importance of treating everyone with respect &amp;ndash; a lesson she tries to pass on to her own trainees. &amp;ldquo;I learned how to apply myself and work hard, while at the same time interacting courteously and collaboratively with others &amp;ndash; whether they are colleagues, patients or referring physicians,&amp;rdquo; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h4&gt;&lt;u&gt;Valve Disease and Magnetocardiography&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Besides her extensive clinical work, she has conducted research on valvular heart disease. Dr. Tolstrup led a clinical trial combining echocardiography and genetics to study congenital bicuspid aortic valve disease, in which the valve between the heart and aorta &amp;ndash; the biggest blood vessel in the body &amp;ndash; has only two flaps instead of three. This defect can cause backflow of blood or make it difficult for blood to exit the heart, and affects 1 to 2 percent of the population.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;While it was already known that patients with bicuspid aortic valves also had aortas that are larger and stiffer than normal, Dr. Tolstrup and her collaborators found that family members of these patients were much more likely to have abnormal aortas, even if they had normal aortic valves. Her team used echocardiography to measure the aorta&amp;rsquo;s size, as well as how much it stretched when the heart contracted and relaxed. Enlarged, stiffer aortas are more prone to tears and ruptures, causing an aortic aneurysm that can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Cardiologists can often detect a bicuspid valve just by listening to the heart with a stethoscope, but finding an abnormal aorta requires an echocardiogram,&amp;rdquo; said Dr. Tolstrup. &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s no way you can find it in a general physical exam.&amp;rdquo; After she and others published their findings, national guidelines were modified in 2010 to recommend aortic screening for close relatives of patients with bicuspid disease.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tolstrup has also conducted research on an advanced imaging tool called magnetocardiography. Her husband, Dr. Massoud Akhtari, is a physicist at UCLA who has studied magnetoencephalography &amp;ndash; a noninvasive tool to measure the magnetic field of brain waves which can be used to pinpoint the source of epileptic seizures. The heart&amp;rsquo;s electrical system also generates a subtle magnetic field. However, detecting this field usually requires a shielded room that screens out all other magnetic sources &amp;ndash; an impractical restriction for most hospital settings.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tolstrup worked with a company, CardioMag Imaging, which developed a device that sits above a patient&amp;rsquo;s chest and measures cardiac magnetic waves without a shielded room. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a very rapid test that doesn&amp;rsquo;t require the patient to exercise or get undressed, and carries no risk,&amp;rdquo; said Dr. Tolstrup. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s more sensitive than what you can see on an electrocardiogram.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;She conducted a pilot study to investigate whether the device could help determine whether emergency room patients with chest pain of undetermined origin actually were experiencing a heart attack, or whether it was safe to send them home. While countries like Japan, Germany and Finland use this technology in research settings, Dr. Tolstrup would like to find out whether it can be used in a clinical setting to diagnose ER patients more quickly and accurately.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h4&gt;&lt;u&gt;Specialized Expertise&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In 2012, Dr. Tolstrup returned to the University of New Mexico to direct their echocardiography laboratory. Her longtime mentor, Dr. Crawford, recently helped recruit her to UCSF. &amp;ldquo;Dr. Tolstrup is a senior clinician with considerable experience in heart valve disease, and specific expertise in the echocardiographic guidance of interventional procedures that replace or repair heart valves without surgery,&amp;rdquo; said Dr. Crawford. &amp;ldquo;We look forward to her contributions to our heart valve disease team.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tolstrup divides her time between the new downtown clinic at 1 Daniel Burnham Court, where she sees general cardiology patients, and the Parnassus campus, where she cares for patients with valvular disease, performs diagnostic imaging and provides help with cardiac imaging during procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;She recently started a heart valve clinic at Parnassus, in collaboration with her interventional cardiology and cardiac surgery colleagues. Dr. Tolstrup and her team hope to attract referrals from far and wide, including community hospitals and clinics which may not have specialized expertise caring for patients with complex valve disease. The clinic focuses on conditions affecting any of the four heart valves, and provides expert diagnosis and multidisciplinary care plans tailored to each patient, which may include careful monitoring over time, a referral to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cardiology.ucsf.edu/care/clinical/congenital/patients.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;UCSF Congenital Heart Disease Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, or the option to have &lt;a href=&quot;https://cardiology.ucsf.edu/facstaff/spotlight/mahadevan.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;percutaneous valve replacement&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://cardiology.ucsf.edu/facstaff/spotlight/deuse.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;open&#45;heart surgery for valve repair or replacement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s my goal to make this clinic extremely user&#45;friendly for patients and referring physicians,&amp;rdquo; said Dr. Tolstrup. &amp;ldquo;For example, to make things more convenient for patients, we&amp;rsquo;re trying to design this clinic so they can opt to have evaluation studies done in their own communities, rather than coming in for multiple appointments at UCSF. Alternatively, we&amp;rsquo;ll try to schedule patients so they can come in and get everything done in a &amp;lsquo;one&#45;stop shopping&amp;rsquo; visit.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tolstrup enjoys the variety of her work at UCSF, as well as collaborating with such outstanding colleagues. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s wonderful to be part of such an expert team, and the level of cardiology that is provided by everybody is so great,&amp;rdquo; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tolstrup and her husband have two sons, Teis, 11, and Niels, 17. In her spare time, Dr. Tolstrup is an avid practitioner of taekwondo, holding a fourth&#45;degree black belt and training five times a week.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h2&gt;Death and Life: Where the Twain Shall Meet&lt;/h2&gt;
			
			
			&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/ucsfhealthcardiology.ucsf.edu/files/images/tseng.png&quot; class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Photo credit: James Hammack&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;One of the ultimate divides in medical research stretches between death and life. Many clinicians spend their entire careers trying to prevent premature death, but rarely learn the details of how patients die unless they pass away in the hospital. Medical examiners piece together the circumstances of death, but almost never speak to the patient's doctors.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Cardiac electrophysiologist Dr. Zian H. Tseng is building a bridge between those two worlds, discovering clues about everything from how cardiac devices fail to how to develop better treatments for HIV. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;As an electrophysiologist – a specialist in heart arrhythmias – Dr. Tseng wanted to learn how to better predict which patients were at risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD), also known as cardiac arrest. Unlike a heart attack, which happens when a blockage in an artery starves the heart of oxygen and nutrients, SCD usually is caused by a very rapid electrical rhythm – ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation – in the lower chambers of the heart. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;A Novel Partnership&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In 2005, Dr. Tseng started a study of blood samples from survivors of sudden cardiac arrest, trying to identify genetic predictors of potentially fatal arrhythmias. He was perplexed to find that his results contradicted the findings of a much larger study that was published by researchers at the University of Washington, Seattle in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;He realized that the vast majority of previous studies all relied on retrospective review of paramedic records to determine the cause of death. About 95% of sudden deaths occur outside the hospital, because patients collapse and die before they reach an emergency department. &quot;It dawned on me that although the cause of death could be classified as ‘sudden cardiac death,' that death could actually have been caused by non&#45;cardiac causes such as hemorrhage, stroke or pulmonary embolism instead,&quot; said Dr. Tseng. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Unless patients die in the hospital, their autopsies fall under the jurisdiction of the coroner and medical examiner. &quot;Medical examiners are busy investigating homicides, suicides and trauma deaths, so the more likely the cause of death is natural, the less likely they are to investigate it,&quot; said Dr. Tseng. For example, in a prior comprehensive surveillance SCD study in Portland, OR, the autopsy rate was only 11%. &quot;That means that only 11% of sudden deaths were proven to be cardiac; the rest were just assumed to be cardiac,&quot; he said. &quot;Yet we can't study the risk factors, underlying pathology or treatments for SCD until we correctly identify which patients actually died of that condition.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;SCD is perennially thought to be the leading cause of death in the US, killing about 450,000 people each year by retrospective death certificate criteria. However, Dr. Tseng and his colleagues now believe that figure may be up to a two&#45;fold overestimate, given the variable definitions and inconsistent methodologies used to define SCD and what they are discovering about inaccuracies in assumed causes of sudden death &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Because autopsy is considered the gold standard for determining cause of death, Dr. Tseng launched an ambitious endeavor: partnering with the City and County of San Francisco's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner to prospectively identify in real time and autopsy every single sudden death occurring within county lines. Dr. Tseng found an enthusiastic partner in Dr. Ellen Moffatt, a forensic pathologist who conducts autopsies as assistant medical examiner for the City and County of San Francisco. She agreed to do a three&#45;month pilot, which led to a grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to conduct an ongoing investigation called the San Francisco POstmortem Systematic InvesTigation of Sudden Cardiac Death (POST SCD) Study. In addition to supporting data collection and analysis, the grant covers the additional staff time needed to conduct autopsies of all sudden death cases.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tseng and Dr. Moffatt meet each Tuesday with Dr. Philip Ursell, a cardiovascular pathologist who directs the UCSF Autopsy Service, and Dr. Jeffrey Olgin, chief of the Division of Cardiology, to review every sudden death – on average, five to seven a week. The group reports on heart measurements, DNA and tissue samples, and toxicology reports. Because the medical examiner can also compel release of medical records, the team also has complete access to echocardiograms, EKGs and other studies the deceased person had during their lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;To date, the group has studied more than 750 sudden deaths. Some of their findings include:&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nearly half of &quot;sudden cardiac deaths&quot; were not cardiac: This profound finding has broad implications, from refining SCD incidence estimates to revising cost&#45;benefit calculations for expensive therapies to treat fatal arrhythmias – such as implantable cardioverter&#45;defibrillators – to defining previously unrecognized causes of sudden death.
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			For example, a significant portion of non&#45;cardiac causes of sudden death were neurologic, including strokes, bleeding in the brain, or Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). Dr. Tseng is partnering with UCSF neurologist Dr. Anthony Kim to study this newly identified phenomenon that they have dubbed &quot;sudden neurological death.&quot;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&quot;Dr. Kim and his group are very interested, because all the previous information they had on strokes and bleeds was from people who survived to make it to the hospital,&quot; said Dr. Tseng. &quot;They actually missed the most severe presentations of those conditions, which are patients who died suddenly.&quot; Dr. Tseng has also developed a research partnership with Dr. Orrin Devinsky at New York University, a world expert on SUDEP.
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;HIV and sudden death: In collaboration with Dr. Priscilla Hsue, an HIV cardiologist based at San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH), Dr. Tseng found that sudden death rates among HIV+ patients were about four times higher than in the general population and accounted for 13% of all deaths among HIV+ patients. Dr. Tseng recently received a $2.1 million NIH grant to identify risk factors in this population, which could include arrhythmia&#45;inducing side effects of HIV drugs and the effect of the viral load on the heart's risk for fatal arrhythmias. Dr. Tseng and Dr. Hsue also hope to develop better prevention guidelines for HIV+ patients, such as if and when to implant a cardiac defibrillator.
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Detecting HIV reservoirs: Dr. Tseng is working with UCSF HIV researchers Dr. Joseph (Mike) McCune and Dr. Joseph Wong. &quot;One of the obstacles to curing HIV is that even in people whose virus is well&#45;controlled, it's still somewhere in the body,&quot; said Dr. Tseng. Unfortunately, previous studies of these hidden HIV reservoirs have relied on autopsies of patients who died of AIDS, where the virus had already spread throughout the body.
			
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;In my study, we are capturing people who are well one minute and die suddenly the next from a ventricular arrhythmia,&quot; said Dr. Tseng. &quot;We're doing the autopsies anyway. In deceased patients who had well&#45;controlled HIV, we can now sample tissues from many organs to see where the virus might be sequestering, in the hopes that we could identify a target for eventually curing HIV.&quot;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cardiac device malfunctions: About 5% of sudden deaths occur in patients who have a defibrillator or pacemaker. &quot;If a person died suddenly despite an implanted device that is intended to prevent that, wouldn't you think – ‘Hmm, let's make sure there's not a problem with the device?'&quot; asked Dr. Tseng. &quot;That's never dawned on anybody before, including the FDA [US Food and Drug Administration]. In our study, we found some kind of problem with the device about half the time.&quot; These included malfunctions with the battery or the wires that sense electrical activity in the heart and deliver shocks, programming problems in the device's mini&#45;computer, as well as physician&#45;related issues such as inappropriate device selection.
			
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The FDA relies on a voluntary reporting system for device problems, which generally only captures issues from devices in living patients. &quot;In the regulatory process we've been missing the most severe problems, because when someone dies, no one looks at the device,&quot; said Dr. Tseng. He recently made a presentation to the FDA about cardiac device malfunction in sudden death, and is applying for a research grant to expand this research.
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pediatric sudden death: With support from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Tseng recently broadened the POST SCD study of adults to include sudden deaths of anyone age 80 and below. He hopes to shed light on a poorly understood phenomenon called Sudden Death in the Young. &quot;There are aspects of pediatric sudden death that aren't operative in adults, such as crib deaths, neglect and child abuse,&quot; he said. Because children often lack extensive medical records, Dr. Tseng and the medical examiner work with police officers, social workers and pediatricians, collect information from the family, and consider scene findings, such as the body position in which the deceased child was found.
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Family Sudden Death Initiative: Some cases of SCD are caused by rare genetic mutations that predispose people to develop life&#45;threatening cardiac arrhythmias. &quot;What if a young dad with three kids dies suddenly at work, and we discover he has a genetic heart condition?&quot; asked Dr. Tseng. &quot;Our findings were part of a research study, which isn't generally supposed to influence clinical care. Yet this is a critical risk factor for his children, who may have inherited a condition that can lead to sudden death.&quot; Dr. Tseng and Dr. Olgin have developed the Family Sudden Death Initiative, which reaches out to at&#45;risk family members of people who died of SCD in San Francisco.
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			
			&quot;My original goal was to prevent sudden deaths, and the biggest bang for your buck would be to identify and risk&#45;stratify people with a strong family history of SCD,&quot; said Dr. Tseng, who is also collaborating with Dr. Bernard Lo, the director emeritus of the UCSF Program in Medical Ethics, on the ethics of conducting research on the deceased.
			&lt;/ul&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tseng's broad portfolio of investigations has flourished in part by tapping into UCSF's outstanding range of expertise, from experts in the Departments of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Neurology, and Pathology to world experts in HIV/AIDS, as well as forging collaborations with government agencies and policymakers. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;Until I embarked on this partnership with the medical examiner, I was worried if one of my patients died suddenly, but it didn't dawn on me to ask the people who investigate sudden deaths about what they found, and how I could feed that back to my practice,&quot; said Dr. Tseng. &quot;We as clinicians take care of living patients, they investigate deaths, and we never talked.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;A basic researcher is in complete control of their lab – but my lab now is the entire city limits of San Francisco,&quot; said Dr. Tseng. &quot;To make this work, I have to understand governmental laws and regulations and all the players to achieve my ultimate research objective, which is high&#45;quality investigation of every sudden death.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Deep Roots at UCSF&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tseng is a Bay Area &quot;lifer:&quot; he was born in San Francisco but considers Fremont his hometown, where he and his younger brother were raised by his mother, an accountant, and his father, an earthquake engineer. He majored in biochemistry at UC Berkeley and entered UCSF as an MD&#45;PhD candidate. After a year of graduate studies working on neuronal calcium channels in a mouse model, he realized that benchtop basic research was too far removed from the bedside and clinical application. He earned his medical degree at UCSF, where he also completed his internal medicine residency and cardiology and cardiac electrophysiology fellowships and earned a master's degree in clinical research. Dr. Tseng joined the UCSF faculty in 2004. In addition to his research, Dr. Tseng sees patients in clinic, performs ablation procedures, implants pacemakers and defibrillators, and leads the UCSF Adult Congenital Heart Disease Arrhythmia Service.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tseng is married to Dr. Kimberly Tseng, a child psychiatrist in the San Francisco Department of Public Health system and the medical director of the Chinatown Child Development Center. Together they have two young children, Ting&#45;Ting, 5, and Wei&#45;Jie, 3. They enjoy exploring the outdoors together, fishing, camping, exploring, and hiking. In additional to family time, Dr. Tseng is a passionate Cal sports fan and enjoys discovering new restaurants with his wife. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/ucsfhealthcardiology.ucsf.edu/files/images/vedantham.jpg&quot; class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Photo credit: Elisabeth Fall&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;&quot;The heart is a truly amazing organ,&quot; said cardiac electrophysiologist Dr. Vasanth Vedantham. &quot;In a typical person’s lifetime, it beats about 2 billion times, and with each heartbeat a precisely timed sequence of events has to occur with very little margin for error. If you don’t have a heartbeat for several seconds, you’ll begin to lose consciousness, and if that lasts for more than a couple of minutes, you could have irreversible brain damage.&quot;
			
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Vedantham’s research focuses on this very fundamental biological process, one that most of us are fortunate enough to take for granted: the basic mechanisms that allow the heart to generate and maintain its own rhythm. &quot;It’s a question that historically attracted a great deal of scientific interest, but hasn’t received as much attention recently, because now when the body’s natural pacemaker fails, we just implant an artificial electronic one,&quot; said Dr. Vedantham. &quot;But I think developing a deep understanding of how the system is designed is very important, and may lead to completely new kinds of treatments that could make electronic pacemakers obsolete. 
			
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The heart has evolved a sophisticated &quot;wiring system&quot; that controls how a heartbeat originates and spreads throughout the entire organ. The human heart has its own built&#45;in pacemaker cells, which are concentrated in an area called the sinoatrial (SA) node.
			
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The vast majority of heart muscle cells are electrically quiescent until they receive a signal to beat, but pacemaker cells generate their own electrical signals – they don’t need a signal from any other cell,&quot; said Dr. Vedantham. &quot;However, one pacemaker cell on its own can’t generate enough current for the entire heart, so there are many thousands of them in the SA node. Each time a heartbeat initiates, a few pacemaker cells may fire, then more and more until you have a wave of electrical activation that exits the SA node and produces enough current to trigger a heartbeat.&quot;
			
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he started his postdoctoral research training several years ago in the lab of Dr. Deepak Srivastava at the Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease, Dr. Vedantham was surprised to learn that a number of very fundamental questions about the SA node have yet to be answered. &quot;How do pacemaker cells differ from regular heart muscle cells?&quot; asked Dr. Vedantham. &quot;How do they become organized and interconnected in an optimal arrangement for producing a stable heart rhythm? Why and how does our resting heart rate change over time, such as in normal aging and with athletic training? How is this different from people who have lower heart rate from SA node disease or other types of heart disease? Is SA node disease a problem with loss of pacemaker cells, a problem with the way they are arranged, or something going wrong within individual pacemaker cells? I quickly became fascinated by these questions and decided to try to tackle them experimentally in the lab.&quot;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Zooming in on Pacemaker Cells&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;To begin to address these questions, Dr. Vedantham knew he would need to be able to isolate large numbers of intact pacemaker cells, something that is essentially impossible to do from living humans. Fortunately for Dr. Vedantham, the basic structure of the SA node is conserved in much of the animal kingdom. &quot;It’s remarkable that animals as large as a blue whale, whose resting heart rate is only 10 beats per minute (once every six seconds), and as small as a mouse, whose resting heart rate is 600 beats per minute (ten times every second), have pacemaker cells and an SA node that are pretty similar to what we have,&quot; said Dr. Vedantham. 
			
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This means that we can apply cutting&#45;edge technologies in molecular biology to genetically tractable animal models in order to study pacemaker cells,&quot; he said &quot;As we learn more from such systems, my hope is that we will be able to dispense with animals entirely and derive pacemaker cells directly from human stem cells.&quot;
			
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even using animal model systems, a major research challenge that Dr. Vedantham has faced is isolating pacemaker cells from the rest of the heart so he can better study them. Pacemaker cells are interspersed with different kinds of cells in the heart, including the force&#45;generating cardiomyocytes, which form the muscular walls of the heart; fibroblasts, which make the scaffolding of the heart; nerve cells; and endothelial cells, which line the interior of blood vessels and heart valves. Even in the SA node, pacemaker cells make up a surprisingly small fraction of the total number of cells (about 1 to 2 percent). &quot;So even if you excise the entire SA node from the heart for further study, only a tiny portion of the material you end up with will consist of pacemaker cells,&quot; said Dr. Vedantham.
			
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To overcome this hurdle, Dr. Vedantham obtained a genetically modified mouse in which pacemaker cells expressed a fluorescent marker, making them easy to identify under a microscope. He then used a method called laser capture to cut out microscopic clusters of pacemaker cells. By laying a thin sheet of heart tissue on a glass slide and magnifying the image on a computer screen, the fluorescently tagged pacemaker cells show up as long, thin green fluorescent cells, standing out from other heart muscle cells on the slide. By tracing the outline of the green fluorescent region, Dr. Vedantham can direct a laser to cut along that line, a little bit like cutting a cookie from a sheet of dough. &quot;After cutting out the area with the pacemaker cells, we then use laser light to catapult the tissue off of the glass slide and into a collection tube,&quot; said Dr. Vedantham. 
			
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By collecting such concentrated samples of pacemaker cells, Dr. Vedantham and his group were then able to profile their gene expression networks – identifying which genes are turned on in pacemaker cells but not in other cell types in the heart, which provides clues about which genes are involved in guiding a heart cell to specialize into a pacemaker cell rather than another kind of cardiomyocyte.
			
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One striking finding was that pacemaker cells activated genes that are typically used by nerve cells to wire the brain, regulate the flow of electricity, and establish connections between neurons, suggesting that although pacemaker cells are still heart muscle cells, they have co&#45;opted part of the gene expression program of nerve cells, which allows them to have their unique electrical behavior. The team also collected and analyzed pacemaker cells from mouse hearts at different stages of development, from embryos to adult mice, to learn which genes were activated at different phases.
			
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Vedantham demonstrated that a gene called Islet&#45;1 – a transcription factor whose function is to control the activation of other genes – is turned on in pacemaker cells, where it activates the genes that endow pacemaker cells with their unique electrical properties. He found that when Islet&#45;1 is genetically removed during SA node development, pacemaker cells become more like regular heart muscle cells, and are less able to initiate the electrical impulses that create a heartbeat. 
			
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abnormal behavior by gene regulatory networks in pacemaker cells, such as the one controlled by Islet&#45;1, may be very relevant to human sinus node disease, which remains the most common cause for permanent pacemaker implantation. When the biology of a heart muscle cell changes, or scarring develops in the heart, the body is less able to regulate the flow of heartbeat&#45;producing electricity through the heart. &quot;That’s why arrhythmias accompany every single form of heart disease, and are often the leading cause of death in various types of heart disease,&quot; said Dr. Vedantham.
			
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the fact that pacemaker cells can change their behavior in response to stresses or genetic modifications raises the possibility of harnessing these gene regulatory networks in pacemaker cells to treat disease.  &quot;I’m interested in testing whether we could influence gene regulatory networks to tell ordinary heart muscle cells to become pacemaker cells, or to tell sick pacemaker cells to act more like robust pacemaker cells,&quot; said Dr. Vedantham. &quot;But first we need to understand how those systems are set up. We’re at the beginning of that road.&quot;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Deducing Cause and Cure&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Vedantham was born and raised in the Chicago suburbs, where his father was a physician and his mother was an interior designer. He earned a bachelor’s degree in physics and a master’s degree in biochemistry from Yale. He was drawn to the human interaction of medicine, yet maintained a passion for science, which led him to the physician&#45;scientist career path. Dr. Vedantham earned his medical degree, doctoral degree in neurobiology, and master’s degree in philosophy from Harvard. His doctoral research focused on a group of proteins called voltage&#45;gated sodium channels, which regulate electrical conduction across cell membranes and play key roles in the nervous system, the heart, and in other muscles.
			
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After completing his internal medicine residency at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, Dr. Vedantham then came to UCSF for his cardiology and cardiac electrophysiology fellowships. &quot;I particularly like cardiology because you can think through clinical scenarios in a way that doesn’t just rely on knowing a lot of information – you can often analyze problems and derive solutions from first principles,&quot; he said. &quot;And with cardiac electrophysiology, during a single procedure, we are able to stimulate the heart, record the response, deduce what might be causing a patient’s symptoms, then figure out exactly where the abnormal tissue is and eliminate it. It’s very satisfying when you can cure someone of something that’s been plaguing them for years, or even save a life by implanting a defibrillator in a high&#45;risk patient.&quot;
			
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to performing cardiac electrophysiology procedures – implanting devices and ablating abnormal heart tissue to prevent arrhythmias from recurring – Dr. Vedantham also has a clinical interest in an uncommon disease called cardiac sarcoidosis, in which clusters of inflamed tissue called granulomas invade the heart muscle, often leading to severe arrhythmias and heart failure. He co&#45;manages these patients with many other sarcoidosis experts at UCSF, including his wife, Dr. Julie Zikherman, a UCSF immunologist and rheumatologist. 
			
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Vedantham is also developing expertise in inherited arrhythmia syndromes, a group of diseases that result from mutations in genes that are important for normal flow of electricity throughout the heart. These diseases are especially tragic, because they can strike young people who seem otherwise completely normal, and sudden death may be the first manifestation of the disease. &quot;When one of these conditions is suspected, we have to use all of our diagnostic tools,&quot; said Dr. Vedantham. &quot;These include a careful and detailed patient and family history, electrocardiograms and other imaging tests, as well as newer genetic tests that can determine whether a patient harbors a disease&#45;causing mutation and whether their family members might be at risk.&quot; Armed with this information, Dr. Vedantham can counsel patients and their family members on ways to reduce their risk of having serious arrhythmias. 
			
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Arrhythmias affect patients in all age groups and in all walks of life, so one of the great privileges of being a cardiac electrophysiologist is that we get to help patients make really consequential decisions that don’t necessarily have a single ‘right’ answer,&quot; said Dr. Vedantham. &quot;We have to take each patient’s particular circumstances into account and facilitate decision&#45;making that fits best with their own goals.
			
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;For example, I often see patients at elevated risk for sudden cardiac death who might benefit from having a defibrillator implanted, an effective treatment that nonetheless requires adjusting to life with a permanently implanted device,&quot; he said. &quot;Sometimes, when the risk is very high, the decision is very clear, but more often things are not so clear&#45;cut. And it’s a very different kind of conversation with a young person who might be concerned about the impact on school and athletics, a middle&#45;aged person with dependent children, or an older adult whose main concerns might be avoiding functional limitations and maintaining quality of life. When I have these discussions I am continually reminded that what is most important in a person’s life can change depending on very particular circumstances, and that patients are often faced with the difficulty of balancing competing values to arrive at the best decision. Helping patients get to a place that is right for them is one of the most rewarding parts of my job.&quot;
			
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to his clinical work, Dr. Vedantham is a visiting scientist at the UCSF&#45;affiliated Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease, where he has worked closely with Dr. Srivastava’s laboratory. He is now establishing his own research lab in the Smith Cardiovascular Research Building at UCSF, where he will advance his work on understanding pacemaker cells and the basic biology of arrhythmias. 
			
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside of medicine and science, Dr. Vedantham enjoys hiking and reading. He and his wife, Dr. Zikherman, have two young children.&lt;/p&gt;

Faculty Spotlight: Ethan Weiss, MD ./cardiology/facstaff/spotlight/weiss.html

		<Path>./cardiology/facstaff/spotlight/weiss.html</Path>
		<FileBody>
			&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/ucsfhealthcardiology.ucsf.edu/files/images/dr_weiss.jpg&quot; class=&quot;imgLeft&quot; style=&quot;margin&#45;top:10px;&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Through several surprising turns in his career path, Dr. Ethan Weiss’s touchstone has been the joy he finds in the process of discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;As an undergraduate at Vassar College, he dreamed of becoming a professional jazz musician, and played trumpet in the school’s jazz ensemble. “I fell in love with jazz, but realized I probably wouldn’t have the talent to be a musician,” said Dr. Weiss. He turned to medicine because he had worked in a hospital during high school, and was accepted at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;His father is a cardiologist at Johns Hopkins, but Dr. Weiss intentionally steered away from that specialty, wanting to try something different. As a psychology major who had taken very few science classes in college, he also struggled during his first year of medical school. “I had probably the least science experience of any of my classmates, so I decided to spend my first summer in a lab to really learn the nitty&#45;gritty of science,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Within the first couple of days, he was hooked. “Some people really enjoy cooking – measuring different ingredients and putting them in,” said Dr. Weiss. “Some people really enjoy tasting the final product. I’m definitely one of those people who enjoy the process as much as I enjoy the finish, which is what drew me to science. It’s also very satisfying to design an experiment to try to answer a question.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			
			&lt;p&gt;He ended up spending a year in the lab with Dr. Pascal Goldschmidt&#45;Clermont, a cardiologist, and Dr. Paul Bray, a hematologist&#45;oncologist. Dr. Weiss studied the biology of thrombosis, or abnormal blood clotting. Ironically, this led him to choose a career in cardiology, just like his father.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Weiss came to UCSF for his cardiology fellowship, spending three years continuing his thrombosis research in the in the lab of Dr. Shaun Coughlin, director of the Cardiovascular Research Institute. Dr. Weiss then completed the clinical years of his fellowship training. He was recruited to the UCSF Division of Cardiology faculty in 2003, and established his own laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;
			 
			
			&lt;h3&gt;'Foie Gras'&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Weiss spends about 20 percent of his time seeing patients. Luckily, the new Cardiovascular Care and Prevention Center at Mission Bay allows him to zip downstairs from his lab to the clinic. He spends the rest of his time conducting research. Until about four years ago, he continued his investigations of harmful blood clotting, which can lead to a heart attack or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Then in 2009, something odd happened. He and his lab technician had developed mice with a protein called JAK2 knocked out, or disabled, specifically in their liver cells. “The effect on blood clotting wasn’t very exciting, but the mice got profoundly fatty liver,” said Dr. Weiss. “It was sort of grotesque, but every time, we noticed that the knockout mice had these big, yellow, nasty&#45;looking livers that looked a lot like foie gras.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;He and his technician consulted with a pathologist, who told them that the knockout mice had fatty liver disease – a condition that affects about 20 million people worldwide, and can lead to cirrhosis and permanent damage of the liver.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
			This unusual development was so intriguing that Dr. Weiss eventually decided to shift the focus of his research away from thrombosis to this new discovery. “Especially in today’s difficult funding environment, it’s very difficult to do more than one thing well,” said Dr. Weiss. “I spent a lot of time struggling with whether I should stay in my comfort zone – thrombosis was a big area for me for 15 years – or invest time and energy in studying this new finding. I got a lot of advice, and everybody said, ‘This seems really interesting – go for it!’”
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p&gt;Beyond learning more about fatty liver disease, his lab is now investigating the role of JAK2 in other metabolic diseases, including obesity and type 2 diabetes. Dr. Weiss and his team are exploring the effects of knocking out JAK2 in specific types of cells. “If you knock it out in all tissues in the mouse, the animals die while they are still in the uterus because they don’t make any red blood cells,” said Dr. Weiss. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p&gt;They also are experimenting with mice that have JAK2 knocked out only in their fat cells. “We’re really excited, because it looked like this protected the animals from getting diabetes, even though they were slightly obese,” said Weiss. “It was very puzzling to us, and remains a paradox.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
			In fact, humans with a condition called Laron syndrome – often caused by a genetic mutations in the growth hormone receptor gene – demonstrate a similar phenomenon. “They’re very short and stout, but they don’t have diabetes,” said Dr. Weiss. These patients also appear to have protection from developing cancer, and many of them are long&#45;lived. 
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
			“We’ve been thinking about how blocking the activity of the JAK2 protein might be a viable treatment for type 2 diabetes, therefore protecting people from developing it, or for making it get better once they have it,” said Dr. Weiss. “The biology is really interesting. The reason the mice in our experiments don’t get diabetes has to do with an effect that’s happening in the liver, although our knockout in this experiment is only affecting fat cells. So somehow what we’ve done in the fat can ‘talk’ to the liver and protect from diabetes.” 
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Targeting Drugs by Cell Type&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
			Although Dr. Weiss has been fascinated by the discoveries in knockout mice, he also wrestled with the fundamental problem of translating these discoveries to humans. “While the mouse has been a phenomenal tool for biological discovery, a lot of things that we test and validate in mice turn out not to be true in people,” he said. And while mice can be bred with JAK2 knocked out from their fat cells, it’s not possible to genetically knock out JAK2 from human patients’ fat cells.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p&gt;
			So far, it is also not possible to target drugs to specific cells or tissues – often a deal breaker when promising therapeutics produce unacceptable side effects in other parts of the body. For example, there is a new class of drugs that were originally designed to treat blood cancers, and that block the activity of JAK2. Unfortunately, they have significant side effects, including causing anemia. 
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p&gt;
			But what if scientists could somehow deliver a drug that only affected fat cells? Dr. Weiss is collaborating with two other scientists – his fellowship mentor, Dr. Coughlin, and Dr. William DeGrado, a chemist with decades of experience in academic research and commercial drug development – to pursue this question.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;
			“When you take a drug by mouth or injection, that drug goes everywhere the blood goes, and it acts on all the tissues pretty equally,” said Dr. Weiss. He and his collaborators now want to develop a way to target drugs to specific cell or tissue types. Oncologists have been pursuing this idea for a while, trying to localize the toxicity of cancer drugs while sparing normal, healthy cells.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Weiss and his collaborators hope to do something similar for other types of drugs. Drug compounds each have a specific three&#45;dimensional molecular structure, like a key with a unique pattern of notches and teeth. The surface of each cell in the body is coated with receptors, each structured like a lock. When a drug reaches a compatible receptor, it fits into the receptor like a key in a lock. In some cases, the receptor will then pull the drug through the cell wall into the interior of the cell.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Weiss and his colleagues want to identify and catalog the receptors that are unique to certain cell types, such as fat cells and liver cells. They also want to determine which of these pull the drug into the cell. Then they hope to develop a “Trojan horse” model of drug delivery by developing conjugates – two different drugs that are chemically welded together. One drug – the “Trojan horse” – would be tailored to a cell type’s unique receptors, such as those found only on fat cells. The other drug – the “cargo” carried by the Trojan horse – would be the medication, such as a growth hormone inhibitor that could potentially treat a patient’s diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“We envision a platform that, down the road, would allow you to mix and match different cargos with different delivery vehicles, so we could take any of these cargos to almost any particular cell type,” said Dr. Weiss. “We think we could improve both safety and efficacy of drugs, because if you could really specifically target these drugs only to certain cell types, you could increase the dose. Right now, the dose is limited by the toxicity, because the drugs are acting everywhere in the body. You could also imagine taking drugs that failed during the clinical development process, and making them safer.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“We also think this could potentially be an important tool in doing experiments in people that were never possible before,” continued Dr. Weiss. “Because biology is so complicated, and there are so many interrelated feedback and feed&#45;forward loops, we often don’t understand the specific action of a certain molecule on a certain cell unless we can really isolate it.” Dr. Weiss and his colleagues are currently meeting with potential investors to form a startup around this concept.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Weiss cautions that this research is in the earliest stages. “The most important caveat is that this is in the fantasy phase right now,” he said. “We’re really excited about the potential, but we have a lot of work to do to demonstrate that it’s possible, and then to take this to a point where it actually happens. But because the reward is potentially so high, we’re all energized to do it.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Unexpected Results&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Weiss appreciates his mentors and the generosity of philanthropic donors, both of which have allowed him to pursue these research endeavors. “Both of my direct supervisors, Dr. Shaun Coughlin and Dr. Jeff Olgin, have continued to support me in doing work at a time when funding is very tight, and a lot of people around the country don’t have the opportunity to do that,” he said. “My existence at UCSF has been a direct result of the Cardiology Council over the years. Also, the Cardiovascular Research Institute has built an amazing endowment from the generosity of donors over the years, and that’s allowed us to do some of this cutting&#45;edge work that would otherwise be impossible to do, because it just wouldn’t be funded by a traditional mechanism.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;And although his research focus has transitioned from abnormal blood clotting to metabolic disease, it all ties back to the kinds of issues facing his patients every day. “I’m a cardiologist, and there is a lot of overlap between endocrine diseases, metabolic diseases and cardiology,” Dr. Weiss said. “If you look at the reasons that people die from type 2 diabetes, it’s almost exclusively from cardiovascular complications.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;He said that following the unexpected twists of his research is part of what makes science so enjoyable. “The theme for me is that we do these experiments, and most of the time what we predict is completely wrong,” said Dr. Weiss. “We expect that it’s most likely going to produce result A, but it could be B, C or D. Then sometimes we’re getting F, and Q and Z, and things that weren’t even on the menu of options. It’s both humbling and really cool.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“A lot of the success that we’ve had in our lab comes from a bit of naïveté,” he said. “We didn’t have preconceived dogma that said, ‘That’s a dumb experiment to do.’ So we did a lot of dumb experiments, but a lot of those turned out to be incredibly important.”&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;“Stay hungry. Stay foolish.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Georg Wieselthaler (pronounced “VEE&#45;zell&#45;tall&#45;ah”), UCSF’s director and surgical chief of Cardiac Transplantation and Mechanical Circulatory Support, said that these words from Steve Jobs’s 2005 commencement speech at Stanford University are the wisest he has ever heard.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“You have to be a little bit foolish to think beyond the rim of your teacup,” said Dr. Wieselthaler, who was recruited from the Medical University of Vienna in Austria in November 2011. “If you walk on a path that 100 other people have walked in front of you, without looking to the left or the right, you’ll never find something outstanding. But if you’re a little bit crazy, you get new ideas, and sometimes it really works out.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Wieselthaler’s own career is proof of this belief. A renowned heart transplant surgeon and leading expert in heart pumps which provide mechanical circulatory support for end&#45;stage heart failure patients, in 1998 he implanted a new miniaturized pump into the world’s first long&#45;term survivors. In 2006, he was the first to implant the HeartWare HVAD, another small pump which offers heart failure patients facing certain death a bridge to transplant until a suitable donor organ can be found. Dr. Wieselthaler also trained as an electrical engineer, and this expertise has allowed him to develop and refine many other pumps.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;At UCSF, Dr. Wieselthaler’s first goal is to relaunch the heart transplant program, which had been put on hold after Dr. Charles Hoopes departed for the University of Kentucky. Dr. Wieselthaler and the heart transplant team successfully performed their first heart transplant in March. “We have to prove once again that we can not only technically perform heart transplants, but also produce excellent outcomes,” said Dr. Wieselthaler, who has performed or supervised 400 heart transplants and implanted about 250 mechanical assist devices so far in his career. “We owe this to our patients and referring cardiologists. I also have the intention to ramp up our program.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Wieselthaler also wants to bring the latest innovations in mechanical assist devices to patients, and to make discoveries about how to further improve these pumps. “We are at a turning point,” he said. “The old&#45;fashioned devices tried to mimic the pulsatility of the heart, but they have more or less been replaced by the new generation devices, which provide continuous flow. Although they do not mimic the natural heart, they are as effective as the old pumps, and are much smaller. The battery and driving units are getting smaller, so the quality of life of these patients is tremendously improved. It’s a new era in the treatment of these patients.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Engineering and Medicine&lt;/h3&gt;
			 
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Wieselthaler grew up in a village in southern Austria, where he developed an interest in medicine and surgery from assisting his father, a veterinarian. In addition to caring for cats and dogs, they occasionally treated more unusual species. Dr. Wieselthaler remembered one client who ran a snake farm, breeding boa constrictors, cobras and crocodiles. One day, the man’s employees brought over a large wooden box containing a five&#45;meter&#45;long python. The snake had gotten into a fight with another python, sustaining numerous deep cuts from the other python’s razor&#45;sharp teeth. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“We put the snake to sleep, and my older brother, my father and I made about 340 stitches,” said Dr. Wieselthaler. “The good part was, we didn’t have to take out the stitches, because as soon as the snake shed its skin, the stitches went along with it.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Although he had this early exposure to medicine, Dr. Wieselthaler decided to become an electrical engineer. After earning his degree and starting a job at a power supply company, however, he found the work less interesting than he had hoped. Around that time, his mother was in a car accident, and died from a brain hemorrhage. “I realized the doctors were so helpless,” recalled Dr. Wieselthaler. “They said, ‘She has a hemorrhage, and there is nothing we can do.’ I said, ‘That can’t be true. There are lots of smart people in the field,’ and decided to become a doctor.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;His father supported him through medical school at the Medical University of Vienna. “I’m really grateful that my father gave me that kind of opportunity, because I love my job – I love to work with patients, and I’ve been very dedicated to them, all my life,” said Dr. Wieselthaler.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;During medical school, a fellow student told him about a job opening taking care of calves which were receiving newly developed heart pumps developed by the university’s bioengineering department. “I immediately fell in love with what I was doing,” said Dr. Wieselthaler. Soon the faculty realized that he also had an engineering background, and persuaded him to work in the bioengineering lab, developing the driving unit for a total artificial heart. He later had the opportunity to observe the first implants of this device in humans, end&#45;stage heart failure patients who were near death and had no other hope.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“The operation was very traumatic to the patient, because you cut out the natural heart, implanted these two artificial pumps in their chest, and had these big thick driving tubes coming out of the body,” said Dr. Wieselthaler. “My friend, who was also a bioengineer by profession, and I watched all this blood dripping, and said, ‘Oh, my God, this is not the way it should be. It should be smaller and easier.’ That was when we started thinking about it.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;A New Type of Pump&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;He and that friend, Dr. Heinrich Schima, went on to become lifelong collaborators in the pursuit of developing better heart pumps. At the time, the conventional wisdom was that such pumps needed to mimic the pulsatility of the natural heart. The design problem is that so far, no one has been able to develop a device that is as small, efficient and elegant as the human heart. Pulsatile pumps remain large, unwieldy and difficult to implant.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Drs. Wieselthaler and Schima decided to buck the trend and work on developing a nonpulsatile pump – one with continuous flow powered by a small propeller&#45;type motor. At this time, there were only a few other groups worldwide that were working on such an approach. In the late 1980s, before the Internet, it was difficult to rapidly share emerging knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Drs. Wieselthaler and Schima decided to convene a meeting. “We wanted to bring the specialists together in a place where they couldn’t escape, where they had no chance to go off sightseeing or shopping,” said Dr. Wieselthaler with a smile. So they booked a ski resort near Salzburg in early December 1988, before ski season began. Between 70 and 80 world experts attended the three&#45;day workshop, and the group was snowed in under about 15 feet of snow.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“This was a really seminal meeting to all of us,” said Dr. Wieselthaler. “If you can’t go outside, you have to stay inside and make yourself comfortable. We were all sitting around the fireplace with a glass of wine in our hands, warming up and discussing problems you could face with nonpulsatile flow. It was very fruitful, because we had a lot of good response within a very short period of time.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The meeting was so successful that the group repeated the experience in 1991 in another isolated location close to Vienna. A year later, a number of the attendees founded the International Society of Rotary Blood Pumps; Dr. Wieselthaler was recently elected to serve as the group’s president.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;One of the attendees at the first meeting was Dr. George Noon, a close associate of legendary cardiac surgeon Dr. Michael DeBakey at Baylor College of Medicine. In part through this connection, Dr. DeBakey eventually chose Vienna as one of two centers where the new MicroMed DeBakey Ventricular Assist Device was first implanted in humans. This was the first time that nonpulsatile technology was ever tried in humans for long&#45;term support. The device supports the left ventricle, the powerhouse chamber of the heart which pumps oxygenated blood to the entire body.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Wieselthaler had been chosen by his department chair to lead the partnership with Dr. DeBakey in Vienna. Dr. Wieselthaler screened many patients, and in the fall of 1998, found two men with end&#45;stage heart failure who were appropriate candidates for the procedure. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The very first devices were implanted in two patients at the German Heart Center in Berlin, but unfortunately both patients died soon after the procedure. However, four days later, Dr. DeBakey’s team came to Vienna, and Dr. Wieselthaler successfully implanted the two patients he had identified. Both men survived and subsequently received heart transplants. One of the patients died a year later of cancer, but the other patient is still alive and well. Dr. Wieselthaler has since implanted more than 80 patients with this device.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Pioneer in Research&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In addition to performing these groundbreaking procedures, Dr. Wieselthaler has been a leader in research. In the 1990s, he and his collaborator, Dr. Schima, developed the “Viennese Centrifugal Pump,” one of the first miniaturized prototype devices to use a magnetically levitated bearing at the inflow of the pump. Other pumps at the time used standard mechanical bearings, similar to the tip of a ballpoint pen. These mechanical bearings held the rotor in position, but eventually wore out due to the continual friction. The magnetic bearing employed by Drs. Wieselthaler and Schima eliminated mechanical wear and tear, pointing the way to devices that could last for years.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;(Unfortunately, funding for their lab ran out, putting the brakes on their research. However, this magnetically levitated rotor technology is used today by devices such as the HeartWare HVAD™ Pump, an investigational device currently under study in the United States. In the mid&#45;2000s, Dr. Wieselthaler served as a consultant on the development of this device, and also as principal investigator in a clinical trial of the pump.)&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Wieselthaler has also studied the long&#45;term outcomes of patients who received various nonpulsatile devices, including their ability to exercise and their hormone levels after receiving the implants. “There are still a lot of people in the field who say, we need pulsatility – the human race is used to pulsatility over millions of years,” he said. “Now we know these patients can live with these devices over seven or eight years, but there is still a lot of information we are missing. This is one of the goals we have over the next couple of years. UCSF is a good place to conduct this research, because we have excellent researchers here.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Besides to serving as a bridge to transplant – helping heart failure patients survive long enough for an appropriate donor heart to become available – Dr. Wieselthaler also discovered that implantable mechanical assist devices like the MicroMed DeBakey pump could actually improve the condition of patients who would not be good candidates for heart transplantation.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Some patients with advanced heart failure develop secondary pulmonary hypertension – a condition in which the blood vessels in the lungs constrict and create high pressures and high resistance in the lungs, in response to the impaired pumping ability of the failing left heart. These patients have poor outcomes after heart transplant, and their only hope is to receive a combined heart&#45;lung transplant, which generally has less favorable outcomes than receiving a heart transplant alone. Due to the shortage of donor organs, it also is much more difficult to find two organs for a single patient than it is to find just a donor heart.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Wieselthaler noticed that patients with high pulmonary pressure who received a pump soon experienced normalized pulmonary pressure, and therefore became viable candidates for heart transplant. Combing through the literature, he found only three papers that anecdotally mentioned this phenomenon. So he and his colleagues conducted a clinical trial of 35 patients, measuring pulmonary pressure before implantation and for several months afterwards; in every patient, pulmonary pressure decreased to a normal level after receiving the pump. “As soon as you resolve the congestion on the left side [of the heart], with the implanted pump, the lung doesn’t see any reason why it should continue to constrict inflow [of blood] – it just releases it,” said Dr. Wieselthaler. “That brings them back to normal vascular resistance, and normal pulmonary pressures. With the pump, we were able to make non&#45;transplant candidates good transplant candidates in a very short period of time.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Collaborative Discovery&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Wieselthaler is passionate about pursuing research that will improve mechanical assist devices of the future. “We’re still at the very beginning of an evolution, and there is lots of space for research and science,” he said. Building on UCSF’s tradition of interdisciplinary research and his own wide&#45;ranging interests, Dr. Wieselthaler plans to collaborate with cardiologists, hematologists, nephrologists, and many other specialists in conducting research to develop better implantable pumps.
			
			&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of the ski resort meetings which he organized to advance the field of nonpulsatile pumps, Dr. Wieselthaler also co&#45;founded an organization in Austria called the Society for Implantology and Tissue&#45;Integrated Prosthetics. He brought together experts from disparate fields, including a materials engineer who was developing artificial hips, a craniofacial surgeon who implanted artificial jaws, a nanotechnologist, and even a geologist who was in charge of one of the world’s largest meteorite collections and was an expert in metal structures.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“We met every month or so for a good dinner, talking until two or three o’clock in the morning,” he said. “We would relax and think about crazy ideas.” This eclectic group brainstormed out&#45;of&#45;the&#45;box ideas, such as applications of a pump that could be powered by the specific frequency of a sound wave, or the possibility of using nanotechnology to change the surface properties of implant materials such as titanium, a concept that could ultimately eliminate the need for implant recipients to take anticoagulants. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Once the clinical side of the Cardiac Transplantation and Mechanical Circulatory Support Program is solidly re&#45;established, Dr. Wieselthaler is excited to foster interdisciplinary research with colleagues at UCSF as well as throughout the Bay Area and Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;For example, bioengineers have worked hard to develop pumps that do not destroy red blood cells, but they still have a tendency to interfere with platelets or other blood components, which in some cases can cause patients to bleed or, conversely, to form clots. “We still do not have a clue what makes some patients bleed, and others not,” said Dr. Wieselthaler. “There are a lot of things we don’t know yet. We have to investigate.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Another big challenge is that the current mechanical assist devices have cables that connect the pump with a power source outside the body, exiting the skin and putting the patient at increased risk of infection. Bioengineers are working on a transcutaneous energy transmission (TET) system, in which a coil outside the body transmits energy through the skin to a coil inside the body. Similar to a laptop computer, a buffer battery inside the body provides backup power, allowing patients to detach themselves from the external power source for a few hours to go for a swim or take a shower without having to cover their external cables and battery in a dry bag – activities which are not possible with the current technology. Patients will then be able to reattach their external power source, recharging the internal battery and powering the pump.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;New Hope for Patients&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Wieselthaler sees mechanical assist devices as the wave of the future. Because of the overall scarcity of donor organs, the number of heart transplants will probably always be relatively limited. However, many more patients could potentially be helped with a mechanical assist device. Since he arrived at UCSF, Dr. Wieselthaler has been doing outreach to referring cardiologists to highlight some of the latest advances. “There are a lot of patients in the field with end&#45;stage heart failure who could derive long&#45;term benefit from a heart transplant or a mechanical assist device, but they sometimes die before this is taken into consideration,” said Dr. Wieselthaler.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Today, mechanical assist devices are currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration not only for use as a bridge to transplant, but also as long&#45;term, chronic support (also known as “destination therapy”) for patients who are not good candidates for heart transplant because of their advanced age, history of a tumor, or other reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;For the right patients at the right time, mechanical assist devices can offer a second chance at life. “Patients with end&#45;stage heart failure can hardly breathe – they fight for every breath,” said Dr. Wieselthaler. “Some cannot leave the house, because they cannot walk. Not all patients can be saved, but there is a large proportion where you can really succeed, even if it’s just for a couple of years. Sometimes it is enough to settle the family affairs, and do things they really want to do. While they are on the pump, they have excellent quality of life – they can fly on planes, go on holidays with their families, play golf. A year to a patient like that, who has been suffering for such a long time, is a gift.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;As he looks forward to expanding the Cardiac Transplantation and Mechanical Circulatory Support Program at UCSF and catalyzing interdisciplinary research, Dr. Wieselthaler looks forward to collaborating with colleagues in all areas.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“I see everything as a team effort,” said Dr. Wieselthaler. “I am not a stand&#45;alone icon, doing things by myself – it’s not possible. For sure, you need somebody to give direction and say, this is our goal. But there are a lot of ways that lead to Rome. … One lesson that I took from my former chief, Professor Ernst Wolner [at the Medical University of Vienna] was… you have to hire the right people and let them work and sometimes get out of their way. Wolner let us young fellows grow and develop, and I want to pass this on.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;This team includes Dr. Ghannam Al&#45;Dossari – another cardiothoracic surgeon who joined UCSF in March – the heart failure cardiologists, residents, nurses, social workers and other professionals at UCSF, and referring cardiologists in the community.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“The vision is to make UCSF an internationally renowned center for end&#45;stage heart failure treatment,” said Dr. Wieselthaler. “It’s all for the benefit of the patients, who are our main interest and concern. We want to give them the best treatment possible.”&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;&quot;In college, I fell in love with cardiology when I saw my first echocardiogram,&quot; said Dr. Roland Wu. &quot;Seeing the heart beating in real time, combined with its importance in sustaining life, got me hooked.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Now Dr. Wu spends most of his clinical time in the echocardiography lab at UCSF Medical Center, conducting stress tests and interpreting echocardiograms, which are ultrasounds of the heart. Because most patients with heart disease undergo testing in the echocardiography lab, it also inspires his research about how the body responds on a genetic and molecular level to cardiovascular injuries such as heart attack and heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;In science, you’re focused on solving the problem in your research, but you really want to focus on fixing the problems in your patients – those mysteries you see in the hospital that you don’t understand, or wish you could do something about,&quot; said Dr. Wu. &quot;My clinical work helps guide the kind of science I want to do, which I hope will advance cardiovascular medicine.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Wu grew up in Texas, then earned his bachelor’s degree in electrical and computer engineering from Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y. He completed his medical degree at the University of Texas&#45;Houston, internal medicine residency at the University of Texas&#45;Southwestern in Dallas, postdoctoral training in molecular biology at Columbia University in New York and cardiology fellowship at UCSF.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;For the past several years he has worked in the lab of Dr. Shaun Coughlin, director of the UCSF Cardiovascular Research Institute (CVRI) and Distinguished Professor in Cardiovascular Biology and Medicine. Dr. Wu investigates which genes are associated with beneficial and harmful responses to cardiovascular injury, and is assessing how different tissues – such as heart muscle, blood cells and blood vessels – respond to such injury. He also uses advanced technologies to edit genomes in animal models, altering and inserting genes to promote healing and minimize heart damage. Dr. Wu also plans to conduct large&#45;scale drug screens to try to find new, more effective therapies for cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;His computer engineering background comes in handy for his current investigations. &quot;In our experiments, we are able to manipulate entire genomes, extract the data and process it to understand what is going on in the genetic landscape,&quot; said Dr. Wu. &quot;In this era of Big Data, it is easy to generate data, but difficult to make sense of it.&quot; Dr. Wu does much of his own computer programming, and appreciates the collaborations with bioinformatics experts at UCSF who help him discover as much as possible from the wealth of information that his experiments produce.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;There are very few places like the CVRI – a center dedicated to advanced cardiovascular research,&quot; said Dr. Wu. &quot;The exceptional research community at Mission Bay makes UCSF one of the most exciting places to work.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;When he’s not caring for patients or conducting research, Dr. Wu enjoys experimenting in the kitchen at home – his latest achievement is perfecting a gourmet style of macaroni and cheese.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;img src=&quot;http://profiles.ucsf.edu/profile/Modules/CustomViewPersonGeneralInfo/PhotoHandler.ashx?NodeID=366743&quot; class=&quot;imgLeft&quot; style=&quot;margin&#45;top:10px;&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Heart attacks remain the leading cause of death in the United States, claiming the lives of more than 500,000 Americans each year. More than 1.5 million Americans have a new or recurrent heart attack each year.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Over the last two decades, new therapies and technologies have significantly improved survival and long&#45;term outcomes for heart attack patients. For some individuals, though, today's treatments are not enough. These patients progress to end&#45;stage heart failure, in which the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs even while the patient is at rest and receiving optimal medications. Most critically, no current treatments can replace or regenerate the heart muscle cells, or cardiomyocytes, that are injured or destroyed during a heart attack.  &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/facstaff/faculty_profiles.html?key=22035034&amp;name=YEGHIAZARIANS%2CYEREM&quot;&gt;Dr. Yerem Yeghiazarians&lt;/a&gt;, director of the UCSF Translational Cardiac Stem Cell Program, is helping to lead groundbreaking research that may offer new hope to such patients. During a heart attack, a blood clot blocks the flow of oxygen to the left ventricle of the heart, causing the destruction of cardiomyocytes and the subsequent formation of scar tissue. Over time, the scar tissue expands and replaces healthy tissue, further weakening the heart's pumping capacity and leading to heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Yeghiazarians and others in the field hope that stem cells will offer a way to repair the damage to the heart that results from heart attack. These &quot;master cells&quot; have the ability to renew themselves and to generate any of the specialized cell types that comprise the body, including cardiomyocytes. By potentially enabling us to minimize the scar after a heart attack, stem cells could serve as a &quot;fountain of youth&quot; for heart attack patients.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;The Promise of Stem Cells&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Since 2003, when he was recruited to UCSF to head the Translational Cardiac Stem Cell Program, Dr. Yeghiazarians and his team have explored this very promising area of inquiry. The group has focused its efforts on three stem cell types that may be particularly relevant for use in future therapies. These include bone marrow&#45;derived cells, native cardiac stem cells, and human embryonic stem cells.  &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In order to begin conducting their studies, the team developed a novel ultrasound&#45;guided stem cell delivery method for injecting stem cells directly into the hearts of mice. Dr. Yeghiazarians' lab was the first in the world to use this innovative technique to demonstrate that stem cells can decrease scar size and improve cardiac function after a heart attack. Now, he and his colleagues are working to pinpoint the exact mechanisms by which this improvement occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&quot;In the case of bone marrow&#45;derived cells, we have found that the primary mechanism of cardiac functional improvement is that these cells produce beneficial proteins that save cardiomyocytes from death during a heart attack,&quot; said Dr. Yeghiazarians. The team has identified specific receptors for this cardioprotective protein on the heart muscle cell and is conducting studies to ascertain whether it can use drugs to activate the production of these beneficial proteins. The UCSF Office of Technology Management considers the lab's findings to date so encouraging that it has applied for a patent for this endeavor. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Native cardiac stem cells, on the other hand, appear to improve heart function not only via the signals they emit to nearby cells, but also by integrating themselves into the blood vessels of the heart and generating new vessels. &quot;Given that a heart attack involves the blockage or loss of blood vessels, the ability to generate new vessels capable of carrying blood back to the heart after a heart attack is a tremendous step forward toward the development of improved treatments for patients,&quot; Dr. Yeghiazarians said.  &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Yeghiazarians and his group have also discovered and published a novel method to more efficiently differentiate human embryonic stem cells into cardiomyocytes and have found that these cells, too, improve cardiac function after a heart attack. Interestingly, even these cells appear to improve the cardiac function primarily via the cellular communication signals they emit. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Much Research Lies Ahead&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;While his team and other labs around the world have made great strides, Dr. Yeghiazarians noted that researchers are still at the beginning of their journey of understanding stem cells. To create a dependable and effective therapy for widespread use in humans, a lot of clinical research lies ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Some of the many questions that remain to be answered include: Exactly which stem cell types will comprise the most effective therapy in humans? How many cells should be delivered to the heart after a heart attack? When should the cells be delivered? Should a therapy consist of a combination of cells? What is the best mode of delivery? Who are the ideal patients for cell&#45;based therapies? Can we improve the retention of stem cells in the heart after cell delivery?&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;To investigate the optimal method of retaining stem cells in the heart, Dr. Yeghiazarians has partnered with a bioengineering lab at UC Berkeley to develop a biodegradable scaffold upon which they can embed stem cells. They seek to verify whether the use of this scaffold&#45;stem cell combination will allow more stem cells to remain in the heart after a heart attack, which in turn may enhance overall cardiac function even more significantly.&lt;/p&gt;  
			
			&lt;p&gt;In the future, Dr. Yeghiazarians believes that the scientific community may even have the capability to generate bioartificial tissue and organs, including human hearts, by embedding patient&#45;specific stem cells onto biomechanical scaffolds, &quot;growing&quot; the organs in the lab, then transplanting them into the patient. &quot;Will it happen in my lifetime?&quot; asked Dr. Yeghiazarians. &quot;I don't know, but that is the direction we're headed. If I had unlimited funding, this would be the project that I would focus on, especially given the shortage of donor organs worldwide.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Private support has been critical to the success of the UCSF Translational Cardiac Stem Cell Program. &quot;Our stem cell studies require a multitude of experiments that take a long time and are very costly,&quot; said Dr. Yeghiazarians. &quot;Traditional sources of funding like the National Institutes of Health won't really support these kinds of activities at the start. By enabling us to pursue our most innovative ideas, our friends in the community have helped us construct a premier center for cardiac stem cell research at UCSF, and I am very grateful.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/ucsfhealthcardiology.ucsf.edu/files/images/heart.jpg&quot; class=&quot;imgLeft&quot; style=&quot;border:none;&quot;&gt;
			&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;width:254px;padding:5px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/ucsfhealthcardiology.ucsf.edu/files/images/bennett.jpg&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; style=&quot;width:250px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Jim Herbert, CEO of First Republic Bank, Tony Bennett and Cardiology Chief, Jeff Olgin, MD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Tony Bennett sang his signature song, “I Left My Heart in San Francisco,” during a sold&#45;out Valentine’s Day benefit for the UCSF Division of Cardiology in the Fairmont Hotel’s Venetian Room.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;On February 14, 2012, Mr. Bennett returned to the “City by the Bay” to celebrate the song’s 50th anniversary, which he first performed in the same room in December 1961. Three hundred guests, including Governor Jerry Brown, Mayor Ed Lee, UCSF Chancellor Sue Desmond&#45;Hellman, and many members of the Cardiology Council, enjoyed dinner and a 15&#45;song concert by Mr. Bennett, culminating with “I Left My Heart in San Francisco.”&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;div style=&quot;float:left;width:204px;padding:5px;margin&#45;right:15px;margin&#45;top:5px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/ucsfhealthcardiology.ucsf.edu/files/images/tony.jpg&quot; class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Tony Bennett singing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The benefit was the brainchild of William Oberndorf, chair of the UCSF Foundation Board of Directors and longtime Cardiology Council member. Mr. Oberndorf, a prominent businessman and part&#45;owner of the Fairmont Hotel, gathered key sponsors for the event, and suggested to Dr. William Grossman that the evening serve as a benefit for the UCSF Division of Cardiology. 
			Mr. Oberndorf and his wife, Susan, served as the event’s dinner chairs, and Charlotte and George Shultz and Diane B. Wilsey served as honorary event chairs. The gala sold out immediately, and netted more than $500,000 to support cardiovascular research at UCSF.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the day, Mr. Bennett received a key to the city from Mayor Lee and was honored by a number of choruses singing the song beneath the Rotunda at City Hall. Radio stations across the city broadcast “I Left My Heart in San Francisco” at noon.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;width:204px;padding:5px;margin&#45;top:10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/ucsfhealthcardiology.ucsf.edu/files/images/highlights2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Charlotte and George Schultz dancing to the violins in the entry hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;A Double Anniversary&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In addition to celebrating the golden anniversary of the classic ballad, the evening benefit also honored the 15th anniversary of the Cardiology Council. The group was founded in 1997, when Dr. Grossman, who had just arrived at UCSF as the new Chief of the Division of Cardiology, and former Department of Medicine Chair Dr. Lee Goldman met with prospective supporters at the home of Danielle and Brooks Walker. “We presented our vision of building a world&#45;class cardiovascular center here in San Francisco,” said Dr. Grossman. “That evening, the Walkers and 30 of their guests attending the event signed up to be the first members of the Cardiology Council, promising to help us transform our vision into reality.”&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The Cardiology Council has since grown to include more than 300 members. The organization’s generosity has supported a number of key faculty recruitments, as well as the establishment of the Cardiology Stem Cell Research Program, construction of the Cardiovascular Research Institute Building at Mission Bay, and the establishment of the Cardiovascular Care and Prevention Center.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;“We are tremendously grateful for everything that the Cardiology Council has made possible over the last 15 years, and were delighted that we could celebrate our accomplishments together at this special event,” said Dr. Jeffrey Olgin, current Chief of the Division of Cardiology. “We look forward to our ongoing partnership with the Cardiology Council, as we continue to build an outstanding program in heart health that is a leader in research, clinical care and education.”&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Imaging and Human Physiology Research Lab&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;We aim to establish a state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art physiology and imaging laboratory for cardiovascular research patients. In order to very carefully characterize patients who are undergoing studies of genetics of heart disease as well as developing a program in individualized medicine, such imaging and physiology testing is needed. This effort will also lead to better, more precise diagnostic testing and will lead to important developments in the earlier recognition and thus prevention of cardiovascular disease. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Stem Cell Research&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The heart is one of the few organs that do not regenerate. Stems cells hold the promise of being able to “rebuild” hearts.  UCSF’s cardiovascular stem cell researchers are trying to develop safe and effective ways to use stem cells to treat heart disease. The promise of using a patient's own cells to fight diseases and find cures – the ultimate in personalized medicine – is becoming a reality. Your gifts will help the center accelerate the pace of scientific discovery and pursue promising clinical applications swiftly, recruit world&#45;class researchers, support training and provide resources to explore innovative research opportunities in using stem cells for heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Heart Failure Research&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Hospital readmission of heart failure patients at UCSF is less than one half of the national average. Once again UCSF leads the field in improving outcomes for heart failure patients and establishing a higher level of care though creation of interdisciplinary teams that look at the whole patient. The collaboration of key aspects of the treatment plan, education materials in four languages, protocols for discharge, check&#45;ins after release, tele&#45;management techniques have all helped improved care of elderly patients in their homes and thus preventing hospital readmissions. UCSF also has basic and translational scientists studying ways to predict, prevent and treat heart failure. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Comprehensive Genetic Arrhythmia Research Program&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The mission of the Comprehensive Genetic Arrhythmia Program (CGAP) is to study and treat inherited heart rhythm disorders. Such disorders are also known as arrhythmias. While not all arrhythmias are genetic in nature, arrhythmias as a class represent a serious health risk. The most serious risk with arrhythmias is that of sudden cardiac death (SCD). Annually, nearly 500,000 deaths are attributed to SCD. Through its research, CGAP aims to provide a leadership role in the process of understanding existing genetic causes of cardiac arrhythmias, identifying new candidate genes, and applying this knowledge to improving patient care. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Other research opportunities&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;UCSF has always been a leader in research, education and patient care, affecting outcomes and improving the lives of countless patients who suffer from cardiovascular disease. In addition to the major research initiatives listed above, there are many other cardiovascular research opportunities ranging from basic science to translational science to epidemiology and clinical research.  To see other research being conducted at UCSF Cardiology, visit &lt;a href=&quot;/research/&quot;&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Fellowship and Training&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;UCSF is one of the top places to train future cardiologists—one of the missions of the Cardiology Division. In order for the UCSF Cardiology to continue to be one of the leading centers in the country for decades to come, we must recruit outstanding trainees and early&#45;career faculty. We are fortunate to attract some of the brightest young cardiologists through our Fellowship training program, which is our best source to recruit rising stars in the field. Philanthropy is an important source of support for our fellowship programs as well as seed money for junior faculty. Annual gifts help to meet the immediate need, while gifts to create endowments enable us to achieve our long&#45;term goal of more permanent and stable sources of support. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;To give toward fellowship and training opportunities, please see &lt;a href=&quot;/giving/support.html#give&quot;&gt;How to Give&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Endowed Professorships&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Endowment gifts are critical because they provide the financial security of permanent funding that:&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Allows hiring excellent faculty that lead the way
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Helps speed laboratory discoveries into new clinical therapies
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Creates educational opportunities sought by students the world over
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Provides for state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art tools for scientists, guaranteeing that possibilities for discoveries are never stunted for want of equipment

			&lt;h5&gt;Outright Gifts&lt;/h5&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The most common way of giving to the Division of Cardiology is to make an outright gift of cash, securities or personal property. Outright gifts offer the distinct advantage of being immediately available to assist the Division in its programs.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h5&gt;Pledges&lt;/h5&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A pledge demonstrates your intention to make a gift to the Division and may allow you to give more generously over a period of time than would be possible through a single contribution. You may make a commitment to the Division payable over a period of three to five years. Pledges give the 
			Division the predictable base of support necessary to plan our efforts years in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h5&gt;Planned Gifts&lt;/h5&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;You can support the Division by arranging a gift through a trust, a bequest, a charitable gift annuity or other planned giving options. Each type of planned gift offers a distinct set of advantages. Some plans provide income for life for a donor or loved one. Others result in an immediate tax deduction or a reduction in capital gains tax. Visit the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.legacy.vg/ucsf/giving/1.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gift Planning website&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about the various types of planned gifts and how they can benefit you as well as the Division of Cardiology.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;a name=&quot;give&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;How to Give&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;You can make a gift to the Division of Cardiology in three ways: online, by mail, or by phone.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h5&gt;Online&lt;/h5&gt;
			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visit the &lt;a href=&quot;http://makeagift.ucsf.edu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;UCSF online giving site&lt;/a&gt;.
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Select the last option, “other,” and type in “Cardiology&quot;.
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are no additional fees added to your credit card when you make a gift online&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
			
			&lt;h5&gt;Mail&lt;/h5&gt;
			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make checks payable to: &lt;b&gt;UCSF Foundation/Cardiology&lt;/b&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;
			UCSF is at the forefront of many exciting research initiatives in cardiology. Our faculty and trainees conduct research at &lt;a href=&quot;/about/campuses.html&quot;&gt;all campus sites&lt;/a&gt; – UCSF Medical Center at Parnassus, the Cardiovascular Research Institute (CVRI), San Francisco General Hospital, the San Francisco VA Medical Center and the Gladstone Institute. &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
			Our world&#45;class basic, translational and clinical researchers are making discoveries in areas ranging from basic molecular cardiology to epidemiology. The new Smith Cardiovascular Research Building at Mission Bay houses four floors of research laboratories as well as clinical research in the Cardiovascular Care and Prevention Center, and was designed to facilitate translation between basic, clinical research and patient care.  &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
			The Divisions of Cardiology are part of the UCSF Department of Medicine, which has ranked at or near the top among all departments of medicine in the country in research dollars granted by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Our cardiology faculty are national leaders in the American College of Cardiology, the American Heart Association, and other organizations, and hold top editorial positions at the Archives of Internal Medicine and many other prestigious publications.

			&lt;b&gt;Purpose:&lt;/b&gt; The Vest prevention of Early Sudden death Trial (VEST) and The PREDiction of ICD Therapies Study (PREDICTS) utilize a single cohort of study participants for two distinct studies, both designed with the goal of improving clinical care for persons at risk of sudden death from heart arrhythmias. VEST is a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial of men and women aged 18 years and older with some heart dysfunction after a recent heart attack. The goal of VEST is to determine whether use of a wearable defibrillator vest (LifeVest, Zoll&#45;LifeCor, Pittsburgh, PA) reduces death in the first 2 months following the heart attack. PREDICTS is an observational cohort study that starts after VEST follow&#45;up is complete. Extensive risk stratification testing will be performed and biological samples collected from each study participant with the goal of predicting which persons truly require implantation of a cardioverter&#45;defibrillator device (ICD). UCSF is both the coordinating center for VEST/PREDICTS and an enrolling site. For more information, contact the VEST PREDICTS Clinical Coordinating Center at 415&#45;476&#45;5149.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;a name=&quot;aa&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;Atrial Arrhythmias &lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The Cardiac Electrophysiology and Arrhythmia Service, has a long&#45;standing interest in atrial arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. The EP group has defined the mechanism of common atrial flutter, as well as complex atrial flutter patterns including double wave, lower loop and upper loop reentry. More recently, we have described patients with left atrial septal flutter. We have pioneered new techniques for mapping and ablation of complex atrial tachycardia and flutter circuits. Current research interests include mapping and ablation of patients with atrial arrhythmias, novel drug therapies and basic science investigations into the mechanisms of these arrhythmias. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;a name=&quot;atrial&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;Atrial Fibrillation&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The Cardiac Electrophysiology and Arrhythmia Service has a large research effort in all aspects of atrial fibrillation.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Olgin has several NIH funded projects in the basic science arena to understand the causes of and to develop novel treatments for atrial fibrillation. The group has several ongoing research trials to develop novel mapping and ablation approaches to cure atrial fibrillation, to study the genetic basis of atrial fibrillation and to study potential way to prevent atrial fibrillation. Within the section, Dr. Olgin has established an Atrial Fibrillation Center to treat patients with atrial fibrillation and to perform research in this area. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;a name=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;Right Ventricular Dysplasia&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;UC is one of the centers involved in an NIH sub&#45;study of patients with right ventricular dysplasia. We are conducting innovative studies relating to the use of advanced mapping systems to facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of these patients.  &lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;a name=&quot;sudden&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;Sudden Cardiac Death and Arrhythmias&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A number of research activities relate to the correlation of life&#45;threatening arrhythmias with genetic abnormalities. Some of the pioneering work related to the treatment of the long QT syndrome was made at UCSF. QT is a measurement of the electrical recording of the heart. We are currently treating a large number of patients with long QT syndrome, Brugada's syndrome and right ventricular dysplasia, all of which is funded by the McEowan Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;a name=&quot;idio&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;Idiopathic Ventricular Tachycardia&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;We are currently studying the correlation of surface electrocardiogram (ECG) with exact location of the ventricular tachycardia (VT) focus in patients with VT in normal hearts. This will hopefully allow for better diagnoses and treatment of these patients.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;a name=&quot;cath&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;Catheter Ablation&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;UCSF pioneered the use of catheter ablative techniques for patients with cardiac arrhythmias. We continue to have a rich tradition of research that results in innovative techniques for patients with serious and/or complex rhythm disorders.&lt;/p&gt; 
			
			&lt;a name=&quot;genetics&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;Genetics of Sudden Death and Arrhythmias&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The Electrophysiology Service at UCSF has a large effort to study the genetic factors the predispose patients to sudden cardiac death, ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia. In addition to genetic disease know to predispose to sudden cardiac death, we are also interested in identifying genetic risk factors for sudden death in patients with and without heart disease. We also study the genetic basis of other arrhythmias.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;a name=&quot;resync&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;Resynchronization Therapy (pacing) for Heart Failure&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The Electrophysiology Service was one of the first centers in the United States to use resynchronization therapy (biventricular pacing) for the treatment of heart failure and performed much of the early research in this area. We continue to have a major research effort in this area, participating in several large clinical trials evaluating this therapy as well as performing research in novel devices and leads. We also are investigating new ways to measure outcomes of the procedure and to develop new ways to identify patients who might benefit from this procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;a name=&quot;smoke&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;Smoking and Arrhythmias&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The group is studying the effects of smoking (particularly second hand smoke) on producing arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;a name=&quot;cell&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;Cellular Therapeutics&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;The Electrophysiology Service has a basic science effort in tissue engineering and cellular therapeutics to develop novel ways to treat arrhythmias, such as gene therapy and stem cell therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The division has close ties to the UCSF Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, with multiple collaborations with individual investigators, programmers, and biostatisticians in that department. Several multi&#45;center projects are also conducted in collaboration with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://coordinatingcenter.ucsf.edu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;San Francisco Coordinating Center&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Clinical and translational research is also performed in collaboration with staff and investigators in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cvri.ucsf.edu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cardiovascular Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;.  The cardiology clinic has recently moved to the first floor of the new Smith Cardiovascular Research Building on the Mission Bay campus specifically to foster collaboration between clinicians, clinical researchers, and basic scientists. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;The UCSF Quantitative Echocardiography Core Laboratory&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;h5&gt;General Overview&lt;/h5&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The UCSF Quantitative Echocardiography Core Laboratory (ECL) has been in existence for over 25 years and helped to pioneer the use of emerging echocardiographic technologies, including MD mode, 2D, and 3D echo. We have been involved in a number of landmark clinical trials and have recognized expertise especially in the areas of dyssynchrony, LV function assessment and assessment of valvular heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;We offer a number of services that include:&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;ul&gt;
			  &lt;li&gt;Helping designing research protocols in collaboration with study sponsors&lt;/li&gt;
			  &lt;li&gt;Providing training to participating centers, designing training materials, and providing on going feedback to study sites on echocardiogram quality&lt;/li&gt;
			  &lt;li&gt;Designing case report forms (CRFs) and managing primary and secondary data in a safe and secure manner&lt;/li&gt;
			  &lt;li&gt;Performing in depth quantitative analysis of adult echocardiograms including but not limited to: LV and RV function, strain/strain rate analysis (LV, RV and LA), valvular heart disease assessment, and congenital heart disease assessment&lt;/li&gt;
			  &lt;li&gt;Providing in depth quality control analysis&lt;/li&gt;
			  &lt;li&gt;Preparing abstracts and manuscripts in collaboration with the investigators of multi center studies&lt;/li&gt;
			  &lt;/ul&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Our lab has access to some of the &lt;strong&gt;world’s experts in cardiovascular disease, heart failure and electrophysiology&lt;/strong&gt; which we leverage in designing new protocols for sponsors.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;We use only &lt;strong&gt;highly trained senior sonographer/technicians&lt;/strong&gt; to perform quantitative measurements. All studies are formally reviewed and read by experienced, board&#45;certified echocardiologists.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Our lab understands the time, effort and cost burdens of assessing both research and clinical echocardiograms and strives to design echocardiography protocols which are parsimonious yet help answer all the relevant clinical question(s) or study aims. We are able to be highly competitive in pricing with many commercially available core labs due to staffing and support from the UCSF Division of Cardiology.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;We follow the most recent American Society of Echocardiography Standards and conduct all of our operations under FDA guidelines and Good Clinical Practice.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;If your company is looking for a central laboratory to perform any of the above services for a new study, please contact the ECL Director, Atif Qasim. MD, MSCE at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:atif.qasim@ucsf.edu&quot;&gt;atif.qasim@ucsf.edu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;a name=&quot;electro&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;Electrocardiography Core Laboratory&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;h5&gt;General Overview&lt;/h5&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Under the direction of &lt;a href=&quot;/facstaff/faculty_profiles.html?key=beacfbca69dde49ef2b522f1ab49364e&amp;name=LEE%2CBYRON+K&quot;&gt;Byron Lee, MD&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;/facstaff/faculty_profiles.html?key=a1e422725fd0fee2b762ee6d11efa5d5&amp;name=EVERETT%2CTHOMAS+H&quot;&gt;Thomas Everett, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, the Electrocardiography Core Lab (ECGL) conducts all its operations under FDA guidelines and Good Clinical Practice.  The ECGL can serve as the central laboratory that will independently analyze 12&#45;Lead ECG, signal averaged ECG, P&#45;wave ECG, Holter, stress test, and Baroreflex Sensitivity (BRS) studies performed by participating centers.  Sample studies are reviewed from each of the participating sites and feedback is provided to the center to ensure that quality signals are collected with low signal to noise ratios for accurate analysis, and to ensure adherence to the protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;h5&gt;Scope of Work&lt;/h5&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The ECGL will provide a reproducible, qualitative and quantitative analysis of all data.  At the request of the study sponsor, the ECGL will develop a Statement of Work document that will outline the sponsor’s expectations, the protocol requirements, and the ECGL’s responsibilities and the scope of work for the trial.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;h5&gt;Quality Analysis&lt;/h5&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;All data that comes into the ECG Core will be subject to quality control.  Data from each of the tests that are involved in the study will be viewed for noise and data variability.  The 12&#45;Lead ECG, signal averaged ECG, P&#45;wave ECG, Holter, and stress test are analyzed using GE Healthcare analysis programs (MUSE – ECG, MARS – Holter, Cardiosoft – stress test). Baroreflex Sensitivity (BRS) studies are analyzed using Task Force Monitor and custom Matlab programs.         &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;
			More than one million people suffer heart attacks each year in the United States.  Despite advances in therapies, many patients are still left with significant left ventricular dysfunction and negative cardiac remodeling. The main purpose of our work is to bring cell therapy from the bench to the bedside for the treatment of patients with ischemic heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;
			Millions of people suffer from complex diseases such as cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disease, and cancer, just to name a few. The main goal is to bring discoveries made in the lab to the bedside for the treatment of patients with such complex diseases. &lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;p&gt;Complex diseases such as cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disease, and cancer share several common molecular pathways that lead to disease progression. To develop drugs for these broad groups of diseases, the TCSCP is focusing on therapeutically exploiting specific common denominators that are shared between these diseases.

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Several diseases, such as ischemic heart disease, cerebellar stroke, and cancer (solid tumors) share the common denominator hypoxia. In addition to hypoxia, these diseases also share a common stress&#45;factor referred to as proteotoxic stress (often due to misfolded proteins), which is also common in neurodegenerative diseases. Despite advances made over the past decades, morbidity and death rates still remain very high with these complex disease. To target these diseases, the TCSCP is currently investigating various avenues:&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.	Disruptive&#45;assay technology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;We have developed a proprietary disruptive assay that can detect various phenotypes of cellular proteotoxic stress.  We are developing this assay to screen more than 150,000 molecules in high throughput screening to detect drugs for targeting the aforementioned diseases. We are able to detect the phenotype of cells that can guide high throughput screening for detecting the desired molecule&#45;drugs. With this possibility, there are amazing and very promising clinical implications for a variety of medical conditions with unmet medical needs. 
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;i&gt;Our goal for this project is to have numerous drug hits that will be developed for clinical utility.&lt;/i&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;2.	Cardiac&#45;specific stem cell&#45;hydrogel system to treat peripheral arterial disease and myocardial infarction (heart attack)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			One major problem in ischemia&#45;related diseases such as infarction or peripheral arterial disease is a lack of blood vessels and consequently oxygen, which results in progressive cell death, and consequently patient death or limb amputation. Therefore, as a therapy, it is desirable to create new blood vessels for providing oxygen to damaged regions of such ischemia&#45;related diseases. 
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			In partnership with the University of California, Berkeley, we have developed biodegradable “hydrogels” that help retain stem cells for prolonged time. When combined with cardiac&#45;specific stem cells derived from the patient, the hydrogel converts these cells into new blood vessels. When creating new blood vessels, it is essential that they integrate with the patient’s blood&#45;circulation system. We have shown in animal models that the new blood vessels generated from our cardiac stem cell&#45;hydrogel system can indeed integrate into the host blood circulation system after implantation. 
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Our aim is to translate these findings into starting clinical trials for treating patients with poor circulatory conditions. &lt;/i&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;3.	Secreted stem cell factors as novel therapeutic biologics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Data from our cardiac stem cell therapy research has indicated that the beneficial effects we observe after implanting stem cells in a diseased heart are due to secreted stem cell factors. These secreted factors are both neuro&#45; and cardio protective in vitro. 
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			In addition to in vitro data, we have shown clinically in vivo significant rescue of diseased myocardial (heart) cells, with subsequent clinically relevant improvement of heart function by using one of these secreted factors as a therapeutic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;i&gt;Our goal is to develop the secreted stem cell factors as novel therapeutics to treat ischemia related diseases.&lt;/i&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;4.	3&#45;D bioprinting of living tissues and organs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			With recent advances in technology and biomedical sciences – particularly in molecular biology, bioengineering, and stem cell biology – we have reached a revolutionary and challenging period in 3&#45;D bioprinting, which will change the way we approach medicine in the future.
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			3&#45;D bioprinting uses 3&#45;D printing technology to create living tissue and organs. A key advantage of 3&#45;D bioprinting is the ability to rapidly produce complex tissue designs from a computer&#45;aided&#45;design file. This makes it possible to use patient images obtained from medical imaging technologies to design identical copies of a patient’s tissues or organs in a three&#45;dimensional space. 
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			We have developed our first printer prototype and are aiming to use a patient’s cardiac stem cells, together with the biodegradable hydrogel, to first create cell patches and eventually print new blood vessels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;i&gt;Our ultimate goal is to be able to print any organs for transplantation purposes.&lt;/i&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;5.	 Exploiting Hypoxia and Anoxia signaling pathways in treating ischemia&#45;related disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			One hallmark of ischemia related diseases is the presence of hypoxia and anoxia. We have discovered novel cellular phenotypes in ischemia and are exploiting the pathways associated with these specific phenotypes for novel therapeutic avenues and strategies, including modulation of stem cell fate for therapeutic efficacy.
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

			  &lt;h3&gt;What is an Arrhythmia and Why Does It Matter?&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			  &lt;p&gt;An arrhythmia is an abnormal heart rhythm recognized as a change in the speed or pattern of the heartbeat. In a healthy heart, the rhythm of the heart is stable because all of the different parts of the heart's electrical system interact in the correct sequence to keep the heart running smoothly. A normal heatbeat is called &amp;quot;normal sinus rhythm,&amp;quot; and at rest the heart normally beats with a regular rhythm of 60 to 100 beats per minute. When disease or injury alters the normal sinus rhythm we say that the heart has developed an arrhythmia. Arrhythmias matter because some arrhythmias can be life&#45;threatening if left untreated.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			  &lt;p&gt;The heart itself is made up of four chambers. The upper chambers, called atriums, receive and collect blood. The lower chambers, called ventricles, pump blood to the rest of the body. Working together, the chambers ensure that the body receives the volume of blood it needs to function properly.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;div&gt;
			 &lt;div style=&quot;float:left;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/ucsfhealthcardiology.ucsf.edu/files/images/heartlayers.gif&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;235&quot; height=&quot;187&quot; /&gt;           
			 	&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt; &lt;em&gt;Chambers of the heart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
			 &lt;div style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/ucsfhealthcardiology.ucsf.edu/files/images/nsr.gif&quot;  class=&quot;image&quot; width=&quot;152&quot; height=&quot;174&quot; /&gt; 
			          &lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt; Normal sinus rhythm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
			       
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			  &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, however, the chambers don't work smoothly together. For example, the heart can beat too slowly resulting in too little blood pumped out to the rest of the body; slow heart rates are called bradycardias. Or the heart can beat so rapidly that it does not completely fill with blood, resulting in less blood pumped to the body than the body needs. Fast heart rates are called tachycardias. Sometimes the heartbeat is very irregular, with no consistent pattern. This condition is called fibrillation.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			  &lt;h3&gt;What Causes an Arrhythmia?&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			  &lt;p&gt;Some arrhythmias are caused by structural damage to the heart as a result of prior heart attacks. Some arrhythmias are caused by genetic factors, and in these cases we refer to the condition as a genetically&#45;linked arrhythmia. Genetic arrhythmias are thought to be the result of either an inherited characteristic or a spontaneous genetic mutation. Genetic arrhythmias are the types of arrhythmias studied by the Comprehensive Genetic Arrhythmia Program (CGAP).&lt;/p&gt;
			
			  &lt;h3&gt;What are the Different Types of Abnormal Heart Rhythms?&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			  &lt;p&gt;There are several types of abnormal heart rhythms. Some abnormal rhythms occur in the upper chambers (atria) while others occur in the lower chambers (ventricles). Listed below are some of the more common arrhythmias. To learn more about these conditions, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ucsfhealth.org/clinics/electrophysiology_and_arrhythmia_services&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; and read the descriptions under the Conditions Treated section in the right&#45;hand column:&lt;/p&gt;
			
			  &lt;ul&gt;
			    &lt;li&gt;Atrial Flutter&lt;/li&gt;
			
			    &lt;li&gt;Atrial Fibrillation&lt;/li&gt;
			
			    &lt;li&gt;Atrial Tachycardia&lt;/li&gt;
			
			    &lt;li&gt;Supraventricular Tachycardia&lt;/li&gt;
			
			    &lt;li&gt;Wolff&#45;Parkinson&#45;White Syndrome&lt;/li&gt;
			
			    &lt;li&gt;Complete Heart Block&lt;/li&gt;
			
			    &lt;li&gt;Ventricular Tachycardia&lt;/li&gt;
			
			    &lt;li&gt;Ventricular Fibrillation&lt;/li&gt;
			  &lt;/ul&gt;
			
			  &lt;h3&gt;What Types of Genetic Arrhythmias Does Our Research Program Study?&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			  &lt;p&gt;CGAP is initially focusing on six specific conditions through which we hope to make significant contributions to both patient care as well as to the advancement of medical genetics:&lt;/p&gt;
			
			  &lt;ul&gt;
			    &lt;li&gt;Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia/Cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C)&lt;/li&gt;
			
			    &lt;li&gt;Brugada Syndrome&lt;/li&gt;
			
			    &lt;li&gt;Long QT Syndrome (LQTS)&lt;/li&gt;
			
			    &lt;li&gt;Short QT Syndrome&lt;/li&gt;
			
			    &lt;li&gt;Catecholamine&#45;induced Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT)&lt;/li&gt;
			
			    &lt;li&gt;Aborted sudden death of uncertain etiology&lt;/li&gt;

			  &lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Once a patient is referred to UCSF for evaluation of what is presumed to be an arrhythmia, an initial clinical evaluation is done by the Cardiac Electrophysiology and Arrhythmia Service group, a team of world&#45;renowned electrophysiologists led by Drs. Melvin Scheinman and Jeffery Olgin. The purpose of this evaluation is to determine the source of the patient's symptoms and find the right diagnosis. At this point in the evaluation process, all patients receive a non&#45;invasive battery of tests, such as: &lt;/p&gt;
			         
			          &lt;ul&gt;
			            &lt;li&gt;Electrocardiogram&lt;/li&gt;
			
			            &lt;li&gt;Holter Monitor&lt;/li&gt;
			
			            &lt;li&gt;Exercise Stress Test&lt;/li&gt;
			
			            &lt;li&gt;Event Recorder&lt;/li&gt;
			
			            &lt;li&gt;Cardiac MRI&lt;/li&gt;
			
			            &lt;li&gt;Tilt Table Test&lt;/li&gt;
			          &lt;/ul&gt;
			      
			  &lt;p&gt;Based upon the results of the noninvasive testing, an individualized therapeutic plan will be developed. Many of the treatments used for non&#45;genetically linked arrhythmias can also be used for genetically linked conditions, including:&lt;/p&gt;
			
			  &lt;ul&gt;
			    &lt;li&gt;Medications&lt;/li&gt;
			
			    &lt;li&gt;Blood samples to be used for genetic testing&lt;/li&gt;

Diagnosing Genetic Arrhythmias ./cardiology/research/programs/cgap/diagnose.html

			  &lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/ucsfhealthcardiology.ucsf.edu/files/images/heartcomputer.gif&quot; class=&quot;imgLeft&quot; /&gt;If your doctor suspects you may have an inherited arrhythmia, he or she will order one or more of the following diagnostic tests. The purpose of these tests is to find out what the right diagnosis is for you and to help determine whether your symptoms are genetic in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			  &lt;p&gt;If your symptoms are determined to be genetic, and you have already had clinical genetic testing that shows no known mutations, you may be qualified to enroll in our program. Our program team will review your request and make a determination based on your test results and their overall evaluation of your medical condition.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			  &lt;p&gt;Tests that are used to help establish diagnosis of a genetically&#45;linked arrhythmia fall into three broad categories and include:&lt;/p&gt;
			
			  &lt;h3&gt;GENETIC TESTING/RESEARCH GENETIC ANALYSIS&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			  &lt;ul&gt;
			    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genetic tests&lt;/strong&gt; can be used to help determine the right diagnosis and the best treatment for an individual, as well as helping to determine which family members inherited the condition. It can also relieve a lot of worrying by determining which family members did not inherit the condition.
			   
			    &lt;br&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
			    Currently, genetic testing cannot find the cause of hereditary arrhythmias in 25&#45;75% of cases. This may be because the condition is caused by a mutation in a gene that researchers have not found yet.
			   
			    &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			
			    &lt;li&gt;When regular genetic testing cannot find the genetic cause, individuals and families can take part in &lt;strong&gt;research genetic analysis&lt;/strong&gt; that aims to find new genes. This sort of research is one of the main goals of CGAP.
			    &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			  &lt;/ul&gt;
			
			  &lt;h3&gt;NON&#45;INVASIVE TESTS&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			  &lt;ul&gt;
			    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electrocardiogram&lt;/strong&gt; &#45; The electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) records the heart's electrical activity. Small patches called electrodes are placed on your chest, arms and legs, and are connected by wire to the ECG machine. Your heart's electrical impulses are translated into a wavy line on a strip of moving paper, enabling doctors to determine the pattern of electrical current flow in the heart and to diagnose arrhythmias and heart damage. 
			   
			    &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			
			    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holter Monitor&lt;/strong&gt; &#45; A Holter Monitor is a small, portable, ECG machine that you are hooked up to and wear for 24 hours. It enables continuous recording of your ECG as you go about your daily activities. You will be asked to keep a diary log of your activities and symptoms. This monitor may detect arrhythmias that might not show up on a resting ECG that only records for a few seconds. 
			    
			    &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			
			    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise Stress Test&lt;/strong&gt; &#45; The Exercise Stress (Treadmill) Test enables physicians to record your heart's electrical activity during exertion. This is important for arrhythmias that may be generated only during extertion.&lt;/li&gt;
			  &lt;/ul&gt;
			
			  &lt;ul&gt;
			    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Event Recorder&lt;/strong&gt; &#45; An Event Recorder (Loop Recorder) is a small portable transtelephonic monitor that may be worn for several weeks. This type of recorder is good for patients who don't experience symptoms very often. The monitor &quot;loops&quot; a two minute recording into its memory that is continually overwritten. When you experience symptoms, you press a &quot;Record&quot; button on the monitor which stores a correlating strip of ECG material. The recordings are telephoned to a 24&#45;hour monitoring station and faxed directly to the requesting physician. 
			    
			    &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			
			    &lt;li&gt;
			      &lt;div class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;
			        &lt;strong&gt;Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)&lt;/strong&gt; &#45; Cardiac MRIs may be used to assess the tissue composition of the cardiac chambers and allows for detection of scars or fatty deposits in the heart.
			      
			        &lt;br&gt;
			      &lt;/div&gt;
			    &lt;/li&gt;
			
			    &lt;li&gt;
			      &lt;div class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;
			        &lt;strong&gt;Tilt&#45;Table Test&lt;/strong&gt; &#45; Tilt Table testing is used to diagnose fainting or black&#45;out spells (vasovagal syncope) by trying to reproduce the black&#45;out episodes. You are tilted upright to about 60 degrees on a special table for a period of time with continuous recording of your ECG and blood pressure.
			     
			        &lt;br&gt;
			      &lt;/div&gt;
			    &lt;/li&gt;
			  &lt;/ul&gt;
			
			  
			    &lt;h3&gt;INVASIVE TESTS&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			  &lt;div class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;
			    &lt;ul&gt;
			      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Electrophysiology (EP) Study&lt;/strong&gt; &#45;The EP Study involves placement of an electrode catheter into the heart, and is a technique frequently used to help diagnose arrhythmias, and to evaluate how effective previous attempts at treatment have been. Serious arrhythmias can be treated during an EP Study through the use of catheter ablation. 
			      &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			    &lt;/ul&gt;
			  &lt;/div&gt;

			          &lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;The mission of the Comprehensive Genetic Arrhythmia Program (CGAP) is to study and treat inherited heart rhythm disorders.&lt;/strong&gt; Such disorders are also known as arrhythmias. While not all arrhythmias are genetic in nature, arrhythmias as a class represent a serious health risk. The most serious risk with arrhythmias is that of sudden cardiac death (SCD). Annually, nearly 500,000 deaths are attributed to SCD. Through its research, CGAP aims to provide a leadership role in the process of understanding existing genetic causes of cardiac arrhythmias, identifying new candidate genes, and applying this knowledge to improving partient care.&lt;/p&gt;

			       &lt;div&gt;
			
			          &lt;h5&gt;Melding Experience &#45; Expertise &#45; Empathy&lt;/h5&gt;
			         &lt;p&gt;Experts in electrophysiology, cardiology, genetics, and genetic counseling work side&#45;by&#45;side to provide a multi&#45;disciplinary focus not found anywhere else in the western United States. This focus is a significant benefit to both patients and their physicians for several key reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
			
			          &lt;ul&gt;
			            &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Genetic causes of SCD can be rare and difficult to diagnose&lt;/b&gt;, and individual physicians often have limited experience recognizing such conditions. Our research team includes some of the the world's leading experts in inherited arrhythmias. Our expertise is available as a consultative service.
			            &lt;/li&gt;
			
			            &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Inherited arrhythmias can affect not only the patient, but other family members as well&lt;/b&gt;, creating unique challenges in patient/family management. This is another area in which individual physicians can benefit from the experience of our experts. Our multi&#45;disciplinary evaluations are designed to ensure that all patients and their families receive the best, most comprehensive evaluation possible.&lt;/li&gt;
			
			                    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Genetic testing and genetic counseling are recognized as critical components&lt;/b&gt; in making the right diagnosis, planning treatment, and helping patients and their families adjust to life with an inherited arrhythmia. For this reason, research genetic analysis and research genetic counseling is an integral part of our research efforts. It is also an important tool for researchers themselves, as inherited arrhythmias can only be understood within the context of family relationships.
			                    &lt;/li&gt;
			
			                    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Current advances in our understanding of the role that genetic mutations play in inherited arrhythmias&lt;/b&gt; reinforce the importance of patient/family management and the benefit of ready access to information from prior genetic studies. UCSF has a vast store of research data. CGAP intends to continue and extend this commitment as the boundaries of what we know expand.&lt;/li&gt;
			                  &lt;/ul&gt;
			
			
			          &lt;h5&gt;Conditions Studied by CGAP&lt;/h5&gt;
			
			          &lt;p&gt;CGAP will study patients with:  &lt;/p&gt;
			
			          &lt;ul&gt;
			            &lt;li&gt;Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia/Cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C)&lt;/li&gt;
			
			            &lt;li&gt;Brugada Syndrome&lt;/li&gt;
			
			            &lt;li&gt;Long QT Syndrome (LQTS)&lt;/li&gt;
			
			            &lt;li&gt;Short QT Syndrome&lt;/li&gt;
			
			            &lt;li&gt;Catecholamine&#45;induced Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT) &lt;/li&gt;
			
			            &lt;li&gt;Aborted sudden death of uncertain etiology
			            &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			          &lt;/ul&gt;
			
			          &lt;h5&gt;The Power of Community&lt;/h5&gt;
			
			          &lt;p&gt;The goal of this website is to provide patients, their family members, their care&#45;givers, and educators a place to turn for information, treatment options, and referrals. Here you will find information describing:&lt;/p&gt;

			  &lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;The Comprehensive Genetic Arrhythmia Program (CGAP) is a privately funded research effort that is the result of a generous gift from the Shaskikala and Dipanjan Deb family.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			  &lt;p&gt;The first study funded through CGAP is our &lt;em&gt;Genetics of Cardiac Arrhythmias&lt;/em&gt; study, focusing on the genetics of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD). Key research goals for this study include:&lt;/p&gt;
			
			  &lt;ul&gt;
			    &lt;li&gt;Identifying new genes that are associated with arrhythmias and SCD&lt;/li&gt;
			
			    &lt;li&gt;Determining how mutations in these genes cause cardiac arrhythmias&lt;/li&gt;
			  &lt;/ul&gt;
			
			  &lt;p&gt;Much of what we anticipate learning from this program should improve our ability to recognize, diagnose, and treat these complex genetic conditions. Our program and its experts will be a valuable resource&amp;mdash;unmatched in the western United States&amp;mdash;for both patients and referring physicians.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			  &lt;h3&gt;Overview of Study Design for Genetics of Cardiac Arrhythmias&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			 
			          &lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Genetics of Cardiac Arrhythmias&lt;/em&gt; is an ongoing, single&#45;center study focused on identifying new genes associated with inherited arrhythmias and SCD. It will use UCSF resources and laboratories for subject recruitment, enrollment, research genetic analysis, data collection and analysis, and follow&#45;up subject contacts. Potential subjects of either sex and of any age or race may participate. Total enrollment is anticipated to be 400 subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			          &lt;p&gt;In particular, we are looking for subjects who:&lt;/p&gt;
			
			          &lt;ul&gt;
			            &lt;li&gt;Have a history of palpitations, fainting, or near&#45;fatal cardiac arrhythmias that are not the result of physical damage to the heart; &lt;u&gt;OR
			          &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			
			            &lt;li&gt;Have been diagnosed with one of the six types of arrhythmias we are studying; &lt;u&gt;OR
			            &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			
			            &lt;li&gt;Are a family member of a person with one of the arrhythmias under study;
			          
			            &lt;u&gt;AND
			            &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			
			            &lt;li&gt;Have had a CLIA&#45;certified clinical genetic test with results showing no known mutations; &lt;u&gt;OR
			            &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			
			            &lt;li&gt;Are a family member of an index (first) case who has had CLIA&#45;certified clinical genetic testing with results showing no known mutations; &lt;u&gt;OR
			           &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			
			            &lt;li&gt;Have beed diagnosed with a hereditary arrhythmia syndrome for which on CLIA&#45;certified genetic test is available.&lt;/li&gt;
			          &lt;/ul&gt;
			    
			
			     
			         &lt;div style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/sites/ucsfhealthcardiology.ucsf.edu/files/images/stereotaxisteam.jpg&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;

			         &lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Photo by Mark Estes&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
			      
			
			  &lt;h3&gt;What You Can Expect If You Participate in the CGAP Program&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			  &lt;p&gt;Since the focus of this research is inherited arrhythmias, there is a strong emphasis on familial aspects. We hope to have the participation of the &amp;quot;index&amp;quot; case&amp;mdash;the first family member with the condition who is brought to our attention&amp;mdash;and as many relevant family members as possible. Evaluating family members can help us determine the right diagnosis and may be critical for finding the genetic cause of the arrhythmia.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			  &lt;p&gt;Study participants can expect to receive the following:&lt;/p&gt;
			
			  &lt;ul&gt;
			    &lt;li&gt;Evaluation of your diagnosis by a multidisciplinary team of genetic arrhythmia experts&lt;/li&gt;
			
			    &lt;li&gt;Research genetic analysis and research genetic counseling&lt;/li&gt;
			
			    &lt;li&gt;Consultation offering evidence&#45;based treatment plans tailored to your specific condition&lt;/li&gt;
			
			    &lt;li&gt;Follow&#45;up evaluation for the duration of the study, if desired, or consultation with your preferred provider. &lt;/li&gt;
			  &lt;/ul&gt;
			
			  &lt;p&gt;Remember that BEFORE you can enroll in this study, you will need to show that you, or a family member, meet the enrollment criteria described above. The study team will ask for records of the clinical tests the doctors used, including clinical genetic counseling or clinical genetic testing, to help make the diagnosis in your family.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			  &lt;p&gt;If you qualify choose to participate, you will be asked to provide a blood, saliva, or buccal cell specimen that will be used for DNA analysis. If your specimen shows a result that, in the best judgement of the study doctors appears to be of clinical significance or utility, your specimen will be re&#45;tested by a CLIA&#45;certified lab; this test will require a second DNA specimen. You will also be asked to speak with our genetic counselor to discuss what your results may mean. There are no other requirements for participating in this research study.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			  &lt;p&gt;Participation in any research study is at&#45;will: You can end your participation at any time, for any reason. You may also be asked to end participation if study management believes it is best for your health. All research performed at UCSF adheres to strict, federally&#45;mandated guidelines for the protection of human research subjects and the proctection of personal health information.&lt;/p&gt;

			          &lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;There are several treatment options available depending on the type and severity of your arrhythmia and the results of your clinical genetic testing. Your program team and your doctor will decide which treatment is right for you.&lt;/p&gt;
			        
			
			          &lt;ul&gt;
			            &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt; &#45; Certain anti&#45;arrhythmic drugs change the electrical signals in the heart and help prevent abnormal sites from starting irregular or rapid heart rhythms.
			        
			            &lt;/li&gt;
			
			            &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implantable Device (Pacemaker)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt; &#45; All pacemakers work on &quot;demand&quot; and are used to treat slow heart rhythms. They are small devices that are implanted beneath the skin below the collar bone and connected to a pace wire(s) positioned inside the heart through a vein; this delivers a small electrical impulse to stimulate the heartbeat when it is going too slow.
			           
			           &lt;/li&gt;
			
			     &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Catheter Ablation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &#45; A technique pioneered at UCSF, radiofrequency catheter ablation destroys or disrupts parts of the electrical pathways causing the arrhythmias, providing relief for patients who may not have responded well to medications, or who would rather not or can't take medications.&lt;/li&gt;
			         
			    &lt;li&gt;
			      &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt; &#45; An implantable cardioverter 
			        defibrillator is a device for people who are prone to life&#45;threatening rapid heart rhythms. It is slightly larger than a pacemaker and usually is implanted beneath the skin below the collar bone. It is  &lt;div style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/ucsfhealthcardiology.ucsf.edu/files/images/scheinman2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			       &lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Dr. Melvin Scheinman&lt;br /&gt;
			          Chief of CGAP Clinic&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;connected to a defibrillation/pace wire(s) positioned inside the heart through a vein. It has the capability of delivering an electric shock to the heart when it determines the heart rate is too fast. It also is capable of pacing or stimulating the heart when it is going too slow.
			     
			    &lt;/li&gt;
			
			    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Clinical Genetic Counseling&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &#45; Being diagnosed with a genetic arrhythmia can bring up difficult emotions, including fears about sudden cardiac death, confusion about a new diagnosis, and worries about passing the conditon on to other family members. Genetic counselors are specially trained to help individuals and their families navigate these adjustments and to learn how to apply this knowledge to their future life choices. Genetic counselors will also help you sort out who else in your family could have an inherited arrhythmia.
			  &lt;/li&gt;

			  &lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Sudden cardiac death (SCD) accounts for 10% of total mortality and is believed to account for 60% of mortality from coronary artery disease (CAD) &#45;&#45; over 500,000 deaths &#45;&#45; in the United States each year. The vast majority of true SCDs are due to lethal ventricular arrhythmias. It is estimated that 80% of SCDs occur in the setting of underlying CAD, and the majority of SCDs occur out&#45;of&#45;hospital in patients for whom SCD is commonly the initial, lethal manifestation of CAD. Despite advances in pre&#45;hospital care, bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and early defibrillation, survival to hospital discharge remains below 20%. However, all of the above estimates of SCD using widely accepted World Health Organization (WHO) and Hinkle&#45;Thaler epidemiologic criteria are based on antemortem data alone and highly nonspecific death certificates, and therefore do not accurately reflect its true incidence nor underlying causes.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In 2010, in collaboration with the San Francisco Office of the Chief Medical Examiner and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we established the NIH&#45;funded San Francisco POstmortem Systematic InvesTigation of Sudden Cardiac Death (POST SCD) Study, a first of its kind partnership between cardiac electrophysiology specialists and the County Medical Examiner to perform comprehensive autopsies for every incident out&#45;of&#45;hospital sudden death within the County of San Francisco meeting WHO criteria. We collect and review all antemortem medical history to recreate that individual's composite past medical history, and integrate these data with paramedic runsheets, toxicology, autopsy, and histology results. A panel of two cardiologists, two pathologists, a neurologist, an HIV expert (as needed), and a pediatric cardiologist (as needed), then adjudicate underlying causes for all SCDs. These rigorous investigations of nearly every incident SCD in an entire metropolitan area represent the most comprehensive study of its kind on the epidemiology and underlying causes of SCD.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;HIV and Sudden Cardiac Death&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;In collaboration with Dr. Priscilla Hsue, we found that sudden death rates among HIV+ patients were about four times higher than sudden death rates in the general population, and accounted for 13% of all deaths among HIV+ patients. We recently received new NIH funding to identify risk factors and underlying causes of sudden death in the HIV+ population.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;We are also working with Dr. Joseph Wong and Dr. Joseph (Mike) McCune to determine where the HIV virus is sequestered, which may have implications for cure.
			&lt;/p&gt; 
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Sudden Death in the Young (SDY)&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;We were selected in 2014 as one of only 10 sites nationally (and the only one of the West Coast) to participate in the CDC’s Sudden Death in the Young Registry, which aims to perform comprehensive pre&#45; and post&#45;mortem investigations of all SDYs in the 10 sites to determine its true causes and risk factors. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cdc.gov/sids/caseregistry.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The SDY Case Registry&lt;/a&gt; is a resource for understanding unexpected infant and child deaths. The registry provides comprehensive information about the circumstances associated with these infant deaths, as well as information about case investigations and their components.
			
			&lt;p&gt;Objectives:&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create state&#45;level surveillance systems that build upon child death review activities.
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Categorize SDY using standard definitions.
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monitor the incidence of different types of SDY.
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe demographic and environmental factors associated with the different types of SDY.
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Guide interventions and potentially save lives.
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improve systems of care for families.
			
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
			
			
			
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Cardiac Implantable Electronic Devices&lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;We recently reported that approximately 5% of all SCDs occur in patients who have a CIED (cardiovascular implantable electronic device), and half had device concerns (JAMA Internal Med. Article and UCSF press release). Our comprehensive post&#45;mortem examinations of these devices can determine whether any malfunctions occurred that may have contributed to these sudden deaths. In the past, device problems have only been investigated as they occurred in living patients, and the most severe problems; those causing, contributing, or failing to rescue one from SCD, have not been captured because these out&#45;of&#45;hospital deaths are rarely investigated by medical examiners and coroners.  Via the POST SCD mechanism and partnership we perform comprehensive post&#45;mortem examinations of any sudden death with CIED to determine whether any malfunctions occurred in these sudden deaths. We are actively collaborating with the FDA to provide these unique data to help improve the design and utilization of these lifesaving devices.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Sudden Neurological Death: &lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Our research into all causes of sudden death revelaed a surprising finding that over 5% of all apparent SCDs are due to neurologic cause, a condition we have coined Sudden Neurologic Death. In partnership with UCSF neurologist Dr. Anthony Kim and NYU epileptologist Dr. Orrin Devinsky we are characterizing the risk factors and underlying causes of these SNDs, including fatal strokes, intracranial hemorrhages, and Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP).&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
			&lt;h3&gt;Family Outreach Initiative: &lt;/h3&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;Our comprehensive investigation, and the precise identification of underlying causes of nearly every SCD in San Francisco, allows us to satisfy an ultimate goal of POST SCD – preventing SCDs. Via our close interactions with the next&#45;of&#45;kin of SCD victims, we can target intervention for those at highest risk for future SCD: family members of SCD victims.  Because some conditions predisposing to high risk of SCD are due to genetic mutations (e.g., hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or congenital long QT syndrome), we are designing a family resource, the Family Sudden Death Initiative, to help risk stratify family members and complete future genetic screening if applicable.  &lt;/p&gt;
