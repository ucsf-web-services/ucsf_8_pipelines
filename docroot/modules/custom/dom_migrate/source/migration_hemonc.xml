											&lt;p&gt;Over the last two decades, researchers in the Division of Hematology &amp; Medical Oncology have expanded their footprint from one or two labs to over a dozen spread across the Parnassus and Mount Zion campuses. As a result, we have enjoyed considerable growth in our research capabilities, enabling us to make a series of important discoveries that have saved lives and improved the quality of those lives.&lt;/p&gt;

			                                    &lt;p&gt;The Division of Hematology &amp;amp; Medical Oncology has a rich tradition of medical discovery, clinical care, and education of some of the field’s most prominent leaders. That tradition is punctuated by a few pivotal events.&lt;/p&gt;

			                                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1976:&lt;/strong&gt; Though the division existed prior to 1976, it was a small and relatively static group. There was one faculty member in oncology, one in hematology, with a few affiliated physicians. There also was a link to the Cancer Research Institute – an organized research unit at UCSF – but the division had no dedicated labs.&lt;/p&gt;

			                                    &lt;p&gt;When current faculty member Marc Shuman, MD, arrived, he suggested a concept that at the time was relatively rare: a faculty group practice. That change was instrumental in attracting fellows and generating resources directly for the division; it also occurred at a time when medical oncology had begun to arrest an increasing number of formerly fatal cancers. The combination of these factors galvanized the faculty and yielded a vision to pursue the very best in research and clinical care. Largely by drawing on its outstanding fellows to fill emerging faculty roles, the department began a steady climb that continues to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

			                                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1999:&lt;/strong&gt; The division’s growth received a considerable boost when UCSF, with strong urging and participation from the division, successfully applied to become a comprehensive cancer center, a designation of the National Cancer Institute. The Cancer Center created an interdisciplinary home for both bench and clinical research, in which our faculty members are important participants. In turn, by building relationships with a burgeoning biotechnology industry and supplying some of its finest researchers, the Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology became central players in some of the world’s most important clinical trials. That role continues to expand as new biologic therapies complement today’s chemical, radiation, and surgical techniques. &lt;/p&gt;

			                                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2011 and beyond:&lt;/strong&gt; Today, the UCSF Division of Hematology and Oncology is an internationally renowned group of clinicians and scientists. We produce a steady stream of groundbreaking research from over a dozen dedicated labs and multiple, leading&#45;edge clinical trials, even as we conduct over 10,000 patient visits and consults each year. Those numbers represent staggering growth from our humble origins.&lt;/p&gt;

										&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ucsf.edu/about/about&#45;ucsf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The University of California, San Francisco (UCSF)&lt;/a&gt; is dedicated to promoting health worldwide through advanced biomedical research, graduate&#45;level education in the life sciences and health professions, and high&#45;quality patient care. A hallmark of UCSF excellence is a spirit of collaboration among all disciplines. The result is groundbreaking life sciences research and world&#45;class health care in pursuit of UCSF's mission: &lt;em&gt;advancing health worldwide&lt;/em&gt;&amp;trade;.&lt;/p&gt;

										&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cancer.ucsf.edu/about/about&#45;us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCSF Helen Diller Family CCC)&lt;/a&gt; combines basic science, clinical research, epidemiology/cancer control and patient care from throughout the University of California, San Francisco system. Designated a comprehensive cancer center by the National Cancer Institute, the UCSF Helen Diller Family CCC has the NCI's highest ranking&#45;which is awarded after a rigorous evaluation process which shows that the center pursues scientific excellence and has the capability to integrate diverse research approaches to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;From understanding normal cellular processes to discovering the underlying molecular and genetic causes of cancer when these processes go awry, UCSF basic researchers are committed to moving scientific insights forward in the context of providing the best, cutting edge care to patients with hematologic or oncologic diagnoses. Clinical scientists explore how a greater understanding of fundamental biological events can be transformed into clinical tools. New forms of therapy, as well as innovations in diagnosis and prognosis, undergo rigorous evaluation for safety and efficacy. In addition, the Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center provides exceptional patient care at five San Francisco medical centers: UCSF Mission Bay, UCSF Medical Center at Mount Zion, UCSF Medical Center at Parnassus, San Francisco General Hospital, and the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Finally, cancer&#45;population sciences at UCSF includes research on the causes of new cancers, and the sickness and death due to the disease. The goal is to develop ways to improve prevention and early detection of cancer as well as the quality of life following diagnosis and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Since the late 1970s, when medical oncology was in its infancy, the UCSF Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology has maintained an esteemed educational tradition that ensures our trainees emerge optimally prepared to become leaders in hematology and oncology research. The result has been a steady stream of leaders in the field, including UCSF Chancellor Sam Hagwood, MBBS, and current Division Chief Eric J. Small, MD.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology offers several fellowship training opportunities. Each program focuses on teaching the most cutting&#45;edge practices related to research and clinical medicine, while encouraging fellows to take advantage of the collaborative environment at UCSF and the Helen Diller Comprehensive Cancer Center to prepare them for successful academic careers. We believe training future leaders in hematology and oncology is our responsibility and contributes to the vitality and advancement of the field. We also offer electives for UCSF medical students and residents, as well as opportunities for visiting trainees.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;The Basics&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/ucsfhealthhemonc.ucsf.edu/files/images/basics.png&quot; class=&quot;imgRight&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Housing.&lt;/b&gt;  As a UCSF Fellow, you will make your own housing arrangement in the Bay Area. We have prepared a &lt;a href=&quot;../education/housingchildcare.fellows.20160919.pdf&quot;&gt;document with information about housing and childcare that is available for you to download.&lt;/a&gt; There are also several links present on this page should help you find the perfect spot. Often, apartments become available as other postdocs and students from previous years relocate. The SF Gate has a great &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfgate.com/neighborhoods/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SF neighborhoods page&lt;/a&gt;. page. The UCSF Parnassus Campus is in between Cole Valley and the Inner Sunset, and just a few blocks from Haight Street and Golden Gate Park. The UCSF Mission Bay campus is located in one of the sunniest parts of the city, with views of the bay and is in close proximity to AT&amp;T Ballpark. The  &lt;a href=&quot;http://campuslifeservices.ucsf.edu/housing/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;UCSF housing website&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent resource, though you may also search &lt;a href=&quot;https://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/&quot; target=_blank&quot;&gt;Craig's List&lt;/a&gt;.
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/ucsfhealthhemonc.ucsf.edu/files/images/transportation.png&quot; class=&quot;imgRight&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;
			Transportation.&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.campuslifeservices.ucsf.edu/transportation/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Public transportation&lt;/a&gt; within San Francisco is very useful for getting around town and having your own car is not necessary for living here.
			However, having a car makes does make getaways to the wine country and mountains easier, and may also be helpful for early morning or late night commutes from the hospital should you be called in unexpectedly. For some, an attractive alternative may be to take advantage of the UCSF &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.campuslifeservices.ucsf.edu/transportation/services/alternative_transportation&quot;&gt;alternative transportation options&lt;/a&gt; including campus shuttles and even cars that you can use for quick trips to the supermarket, Costco and Target
			&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Activities at UCSF&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/ucsfhealthhemonc.ucsf.edu/files/images/activites.png&quot; class=&quot;imgRight&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sports and Athletics at the UCSF Campus.&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.campuslifeservices.ucsf.edu/fitnessrecreation/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fitness and Recreation&lt;/a&gt; are important activities in the city.  San Francisco offers a variety of running trails, bicycle paths and outdoor recreation opportunities. Moreover, UCSF Fitness and Recreation maintains a pool, racquetball courts, basketball and volleyball facilities, a rock wall and a spacious fitness center with a full line of Cybex weight machines, aerobic machines and free weights at both Parnassus and Mission Bay campuses. Intramural team sports, martial arts and aerobic classes are scheduled, as well as a syllabus of recreational classes. Outdoors Unlimited sponsors ski cabins at Tahoe and Heavenly Valley, rents camping and aquatic equipment, and teaches classes in sail boarding on the San Francisco Bay.
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Weather.&lt;/b&gt;  The weather in San Francisco is usually cool and moderate all year. Other parts of the Bay Area experience clear and very warm weather in the summer months. Outdoor activities can be enjoyed year round. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inpatient Rotations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;During the first phase of training, fellows participate in inpatient rotations at three separate campuses that take advantage of the tremendous diversity in the San Francisco Bay Area's patient populations. These campuses are:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;UCSF&#45;Moffitt/Long Hospitals (Parnassus campus): A 688&#45;bed tertiary care hospital. Fellows rotate through the leukemia/lymphoma/transplant service, and an inpatient hematology and oncology consult service.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH): A 686&#45;bed county hospital serving a large, multi&#45;ethnic population. Fellows rotate through a hematology and oncology consult service.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Veterans Administration Medical Center (VAMC): A 112&#45;bed hospital serving northern California. Fellows participate in a hybrid rotation consisting of time on the hematology and oncology consult service and in the outpatient clinics.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;

			&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Outpatient Rotations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Fellows also participate in a minimum of one continuity clinic session per week throughout their entire training. During the clinical phase of training, the continuity clinics are in six month blocks and include VAMC Heme/Onc, SFGH Onc, and either UCSF Parnassus Hematology or SFGH Hematology (if boarding in Hematology). In addition, dedicated one&#45;month outpatient rotations are offered at UCSF Medical Center (Parnassus Malignant Hematology), the Veterans Administration Medical Center (VAMC Heme/Onc), and at the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center at Mount Zion (solid tumor oncology).&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;San Francisco General Hospital and Veterans Administration Medical Center clinics are general oncology or general hematology clinics. Clinics at the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center are disease&#45;oriented and multi&#45;disciplinary, affording close interaction between medical oncologists, surgical oncologists, and radiation oncologists. Examples of disease&#45; or area&#45;specific clinics at UCSF include:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Breast oncology&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Genitourinary oncology&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Gastrointestinal oncology&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Gynecologic oncology&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Head and Neck oncology&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Leukemia/Lymphoma/Transplantation&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Multiple myeloma&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Melanoma and Cutaneous Malignancies&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Thoracic oncology&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Orthopedic oncology/sarcoma&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Developmental Therapeutics/Phase I &lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Neuro&#45;Oncology&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Complementary medicine&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Psycho&#45;Oncology&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Symptom Management&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Nursing and social work support is available at all sites, with providers frequently incorporated into care teams.  Tumor boards and teaching conferences are held regularly at all locations.  At the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center the conferences are disease&#45;specific (e.g. Breast Oncology, GI Oncology, Thoracic Oncology). Tumor boards afford the opportunity to review cases in a multidisciplinary setting. Participants include representatives from medical oncology, pathology, radiology, surgical oncology, radiation oncology, genetic counseling, and nursing.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;An evidence&#45;based approach to clinical care is emphasized—along with translating advances in clinical and laboratory&#45;based research to the clinic. There are several opportunities for formal teaching related to clinical medicine, including rotation site&#45;specific Tumor Boards and other conferences, as well as, our Division&#45;wide weekly Clinical Case Conferences and Journal Club meetings, and monthly Morbidity and Mortality conferences.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our Goal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The UCSF Hematology&#45;Oncology Fellowship Training Program provides rigorous and comprehensive training in:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;The prevention, detection, evaluation and treatment of cancer, and of benign hematological disorders, leading to board eligibility in medical oncology and/or hematology.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Clinical and translational research, including trial design and methodology, biostatistics and ethics.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Laboratory&#45;based research&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;

			&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Program Overview&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;To develop future leaders in hematology and oncology, we have developed a comprehensive program composed of a core curriculum, clinical training, and research training.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;During &lt;a href=&quot;/education/fellowships/acgme/clinical_training.html&quot;&gt;clinical training&lt;/a&gt;, fellows learn the fundamental principles underlying the prevention, detection, evaluation and treatment of cancer and benign hematological disorders. Clinical training includes a comprehensive schedule of didactic lectures, regular conferences (e.g. Case Conference, Morbidity and Mortality Conference, and Tumor Boards), and a rich mix of clinical rotations. By rotating on inpatient and outpatient services at multiple clinical sites, our fellows see and care for an extraordinarily diverse group of patients.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The broad clinical training obtained at UCSF provides the context for the &lt;a href=&quot;/education/fellowships/acgme/research_training.html&quot;&gt;research phase of training&lt;/a&gt;. In this phase of the program, fellows work with mentors on clinical, translational, or laboratory research projects. Through this mentored research experience our fellows learn how to develop and execute a research plan and how to secure independent funding for their work. In addition, all research fellows participate in monthly workshops designed to provide training in the fundamentals of clinical research methodology, cancer biology, drug development, grant&#45;writing, and other relevant topics. Many of our fellows also take advantage of formal coursework offered at UCSF. All fellows attend national meetings (at which they present their work if invited).&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;For individuals seeking board&#45;eligibility in Hematology OR Medical Oncology, the clinical phase of fellowship training is one year and the research phase is one year (total 24 months). Individuals seeking board&#45;eligibility in BOTH Hematology AND Medical Oncology require an additional six months of clinical and research training (18 months clinical plus 18 months research for total of 36 months).&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Core Curriculum and Didactics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The core curriculum covers:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Epidemiology, prevention, diagnosis and treatment of all major malignancies&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Biology and treatment of benign hematological conditions&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Cancer Biology: pathophysiology, molecular biology, and use of state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art technologies for target and biomarker discovery and validation&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Cancer Medicine: pharmacology, supportive care, general care, ethics of caring for cancer patients&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Clinical Research Methods: clinical research methodology, biostatistics, ethics of clinical research&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Career Development: workshops in grant writing, manuscript preparation, CV preparation, and developing a career in clinical and laboratory research.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;The UCSF fellowship program in Hematology/Oncology has been in existence since the 1960s and is rooted in our ability to combine extraordinarily broad&#45;based clinical training across multiple sites and diverse patient populations with unparalleled biomedical research opportunities. As such our mission is to train leaders in hematology&#45;oncology research. A review of recent graduates from our &lt;a href=&quot;https://hemonc.ucsf.edu/education/fellows.html&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;program&lt;/a&gt; highlights the success of our program, with 64% pursuing a career in research of some type (of these, 75% of graduates stayed in academic medicine and 25% secured jobs in pharma/biotechnnology).  &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Having experienced significant growth over the past 15 years, there are now over 50 members in the Division of Hematology/Oncology. Many of our faculty hold leadership positions nationally and/or locally (within the Cancer Center, Division, School of Medicine and/or Department of Medicine).  &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Clinical Training During Fellowship&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Clinical training related to cancer care involves rotations and clinics at several sites over the first 12&#45;18 months of ACGME training. At the Parnassus campus, fellows obtain a tertiary care experience on the inpatient Hematologic Malignancies and Transplant service, as well as the general Hematology/Oncology consult service. In addition, fellows rotate in outpatient Non&#45;malignant and Malignant Hematology Clinics. Fellows also rotate on the Hematology/Oncology consult services at the San Francisco Veterans Administration Medical Center (VAMC) and San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH). Both sites provide critically important outpatient experiences in the form of a general Hematology/Oncology continuity clinic at the VAMC, as well as separate Hematology and Oncology continuity clinics at SFGH. SFGH also offers specialized training in the care of patients with sickle cell disease for fellows boarding in Hematology. In the context of several dedicated outpatient months or research phase continuity clinics, fellows also rotate through disease&#45;specific specialty clinics located at the UCSF Mount Zion campus and the new UCSF Mission Bay campus (solid tumor oncology).&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Clinical training is typically front&#45;loaded during fellowship, with 12&#45;18 months of clinical training (depending on whether a fellow is single boarding or double boarding) followed by dedicated research time.  A block of research time early in second year is encouraged for double boarding fellows interested in clinical research as a means of “jump starting” their research effort in anticipation of completing six additional months of clinical training later in the year. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The clinical training program for Hematology/Oncology fellows at UCSF has been substantially modified over the past several years to maximize the educational opportunities available at each site, minimize service, reduce weekend call, and increase outpatient time.&lt;/b&gt; Outpatient months include time for “research on research”, including meetings with advisors and potential research mentors and attendance at disease&#45; or research&#45;specific group meetings. Fellows single boarding in Medical Oncology have six outpatient months (out of 12 months of clinical training). In 2015&#45;16, trainees double boarding in Hematology/Oncology will have a total of seven outpatient months (out of 18 months of clinical training).&lt;/p&gt;


			&lt;h3&gt;Mentorship and Research Training for Fellows&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Each incoming fellow is assigned an advisor before starting fellowship training; trainees meet with their advisors at least quarterly during the clinical phase of training. The advisor's role is to help the fellow navigate the clinical phase of training, focus his/her research interests, and identify potential mentors. The advisor assists in the selection of research mentors and remains a resource throughout the research phase of training. All research mentors are independent clinical and/or laboratory investigators with independent funding and strong mentoring track records. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Research opportunities are extensive for trainees interested in traditional clinical and laboratory research.  In addition, fellows can take advantage of expertise in research related to &lt;a href=&quot;http://globalhealthsciences.ucsf.edu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;global health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.epibiostat.ucsf.edu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;epidemiology/outcomes&lt;/a&gt;. Translational research is emphasized, with support from the Clinical &amp; Translational Science Institute (CTSI), a cross&#45;school, campus&#45;wide virtual institute dedicated to providing education, services, and infrastructure to support &lt;a href=&quot;http://ctsi.ucsf.edu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;translational research&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://ctsi.ucsf.edu/about&#45;us/programs/clinical&#45;translational&#45;science&#45;training&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;all types at UCSF&lt;/a&gt;. Trainees may work with mentors in or outside of the Division of Hematology/Oncology. While these opportunities extend throughout the entire UCSF community, many are found at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center web site (&lt;a href=&quot;http://cancer.ucsf.edu/research/programs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://cancer.ucsf.edu/research/programs&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://cancer.ucsf.edu/people&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://cancer.ucsf.edu/people&lt;/a&gt;), the &lt;a href=&quot;https://tetrad.ucsf.edu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TETRAD graduate program website&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bms.ucsf.edu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Biomedical Sciences (BMS) graduate program website&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://immunology.ucsf.edu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;UCSF Immunology Program website&lt;/a&gt;, or the Eli and &lt;a href=&quot;https://stemcell.ucsf.edu/faculty&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Edythe Broad Center of Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research website&lt;/a&gt;. Trainees who choose a mentor outside of the Division of Hematology/Oncology, also identify a co&#45;mentor from within the Division. In addition, research phase fellows are encouraged to maintain a continuity clinic that meshes with their research interests and participation in relevant disease&#45;specific research meetings and Hereditary Cancer Tumor Boards is also encouraged, &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Prior to beginning the research phase of training, each fellow prepares a short research proposal outlining his/her research plan (including the background, aims, methodology, limitations, and timeline for the primary project). In addition, trainees are asked to outline their plans regarding secondary projects, attendance at national meetings, participation in national workshops, and applications for external funding. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Funding for fellows comes from training grants, disease&#45;specific funds, or contract and grant revenue, supplemented by institutional sources as necessary. The ability to secure funding is an integral part of a successful academic career and fellows should consider obtaining independent funding to be an important program goal. To help achieve that goal, during the research phase of training, fellows work with their mentors to identify and apply for a range of funding opportunities. The Hematology/Oncology fellowship program supports this effort by providing pre&#45;award administrative support, grant&#45;writing training, updates on available funding opportunities, and access to a library of funded grants. K award counseling is provided free of cost by the CTSI and participation in campus&#45;wide grant&#45;writing courses is encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;All research fellows participate in monthly Friday Educational Sessions devoted to career development and other relevant topics. Fellows also receive an educational stipend to support attendance at at least one scientific meeting per year. Research phase fellows also attend at least one Disease&#45;Specific Site Committee meeting (at which ongoing and planned trials and adverse events are reviewed), one IRB meeting and one Comprehensive Cancer Center Protocol Scientific Review Committee meeting in an effort to learn the fundamental principles underlying clinical research (e.g. informed consent, best research practices, scientific review).&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Three years of funding are provided for all fellows.&lt;/b&gt; This includes one additional year of funded research for fellows who have elected to single board in Hematology or Oncology.   Additional funding is provided for fellows participating in the ABIM Research Pathway. Support for additional non&#45;ACGME training is provided on a case by case basis.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Clinical Research Training&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Fellows pursuing clinical research training meet with their mentors regularly to ensure development of a focused and testable hypothesis. A Cancer Center statistician works with the fellow to develop the clinical protocol, with support from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cancer.ucsf.edu/itr/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Investigational Therapeutics Resource&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cancer.ucsf.edu/itr/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center&lt;/a&gt; as needed. The mentor oversees trial design and conduct, regulatory requirements, and data collection analysis and interpretation. Collaboration with multi&#45;disciplinary research teams, including basic scientists, statisticians and other clinician&#45;scientists is considered to be an integral part of this process. The work culminates in a research presentation (ideally at a national or international meeting) and manuscript preparation.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;During this period, the fellow maintains focused clinical activity in the appropriate subspecialty clinic(s) and receives ongoing clinical training, including formal coursework or participation in national workshops as appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Laboratory Research Training&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Laboratory&#45;based fellows are encouraged to attend relevant meetings (within and outside of UCSF) to interact with other trainees, investigators, and distinguished scientists from other institutions (e.g. retreats, lab meetings, seminars, journal clubs). Informal presentations of research occur regularly, either in the form of regular group meetings, Research in Progress seminars, retreats or disease&#45;related meetings on campus.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;All laboratory research fellows continue to maintain one half&#45;day outpatient continuity clinic session per week. The goal of the ongoing clinical activity is to maintain clinical excellence, as well as to provide context to the laboratory&#45;based research.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;Overall Clinical, Research, and Training Environment at UCSF&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Founded 150 years ago, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ucsf.edu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;UCSF&lt;/a&gt; is the only campus in the 10&#45;campus UC system dedicated exclusively to the health sciences.  UCSF's cadre of exceptional scientists, trainees and staff, embrace the pervasive spirit of collaboration and entrepreneurship. Together, they are leading revolutions in health in pursuit of its advancing health worldwide™ mission. UCSF faculty include five Nobel laureates and many leaders in their fields across the United States and world. Forty&#45;nine faculty are members of the National Academy of Sciences, 18 belong to the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, 12 are Lasker award recipients, and 61 are members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Reflecting the high caliber of its vast research enterprise, UCSF was rated to be in the top 5 universities world&#45;wide for both medicine and life sciences according to the 2014 academic ranking of world universities. UCSF ranked first among public institutions and second among all institutions nationwide in research support from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for fiscal year 2014, garnering a total of $546.6 million. The UCSF School of Medicine topped the list of NIH funding for medical schools for the 3rd year in the row.  The UCSF Schools of Pharmacy, Dentistry, and Nursing also ranked first in their fields for NIH funding for 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;All four UCSF professional schools, virtually all UCSF graduate programs, UCSF Medical Center and UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital consistently rank among the best in the country, according to the latest surveys by U.S. News &amp; World Report. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Patient Care at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ucsf.edu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;UCSF&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;UCSF's health care providers are among the nation’s leading experts in virtually all specialties, including cancer, heart disease, neurological disorders, immunological disorders, HIV/AIDS and organ transplantation, as well as specialty services for women and children.  As a result, UCSF Medical Center and UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital San Francisco are ranked among the best hospitals in the U.S with a mission focused on Caring, Healing, Teaching and Discovering. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UCSF Medical Center&lt;/b&gt; has three major sites at &lt;b&gt;Parnassus, Mount Zion and Mission Bay&lt;/b&gt; campuses and serves as a referral center for patients requiring highly specialized medical care that involves advanced and complex procedures. &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ucsfmissionbayhospitals.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;UCSF Medical Center at Mission Bay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is our newest state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art hospital complex for women, children and cancer (open 2/2015). Built alongside UC San Francisco's vibrant research hub, our new hospitals bring together leading physicians and scientists to accelerate the translation of laboratory discoveries into actual treatments and cures. UCSF also serves the city’s vulnerable populations at its affiliates &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sfgh.ucsf.edu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH) and Trauma Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;  and the &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://medicine.ucsf.edu/campuses/vamc.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;San Francisco Veteran Affairs Medical Center  (VAMC)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. As an example, the patient population at SFGH consists patients self&#45;identifying as: White (23%), African American (17%), Native American (1%), Asian Pacific Islander (23%), and other/unknown (7%), Twelve percent of patients are under 18, 43% 18&#45;&#45;44, 36% 45&#45;64, and 9% over 64; 37% of patients are uninsured.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the diverse treatment sites available within the UCSF system affords our fellows exposure to extraordinarily diverse patient populations (i.e. socioeconomic, racial, ethnic, and cultural diversity) and health care systems (VA, county hospital, university&#45;based) in the context of their clinical training. The combined experience ensures that our fellows complete our program with a solid understanding of cancer care across diverse settings and patient populations.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Research at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ucsf.edu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;UCSF&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Research programs in the basic, clinical, social and behavioral, and population sciences at UCSF are recognized internationally. Preeminent faculty, who are conducting basic science investigations at the genetic, cellular, molecular and systems level, are exploring the fundamental mechanisms of biology and discovering new solutions for preventing and treating a wide array of diseases. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Translating this research into new therapies is fundamental to UCSF’s public mission. To that end, the campus has more than 650 active patents and continues to disclose hundreds of life science inventions each year. It also has spawned more than 90 life sciences companies – including the first biotech company, Genentech – and continues to collaborate with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as foundations and patient advocacy groups, to help move discoveries more effectively from laboratory to clinical trials and into the community.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;To speed up urgently needed practices, policies, therapies and cures for public benefit, &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ctsi.ucsf.edu/about&#45;us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;UCSF’s Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was established in 2006 with a $108 million grant from the NIH as part of a national mandate and movement. CTSI received renewal funding in 2011 with a second five&#45;year award of $112 million. To achieve its goals, CTSI provides infrastructure, services, and training to support clinical and translational research (including programs in Biomedical Informatics, Career Development, Clinical Research Services, Early Translational Research, Global Health, Community Engagement and Heath Policy, Clinical and Translational Science Training, etc.).  In addition, the CTSI develops broad coalitions and partnerships at the local and national levels to enable a transformation of the research environment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Education at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ucsf.edu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;UCSF&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/b&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;At its core, UCSF remains an institution of higher learning, a place where tomorrow’s leaders in the life sciences, health care and health policy get their education and training. It serves as a magnet for the world’s top faculty, students, residents and postdoctoral scholars – a community of the best and the brightest. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The four professional schools and Graduate Division all rank among the nation’s most prestigious advanced study programs in the health sciences, and their academic missions reflect UCSF’s innovative spirit by emphasizing health care advocacy, pioneering patient care and interdisciplinary collaboration:  &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;School of Dentistry&lt;/b&gt; is recognized nationwide for its novel approaches to dental education, including combined DDS&#45;PhD and DDS&#45;MBA programs and a special one&#45;year training course geared to helping disadvantaged students gain admission to US dental schools. The school teaches and practices a philosophy of minimally invasive dentistry that embraces prevention before surgical intervention. US News &amp; World Report does not rank dentistry schools.&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;School of Medicine&lt;/b&gt; ranks in third place nationwide, according to the 2015 survey by US News &amp; World Report. The survey ranks medical schools according to the quality of training in both research and primary care. UCSF has the only medical school in the nation that ranks in the top five in both categories. The school encourages its students to incorporate inquiry, innovation and discovery throughout their careers, whether in private practice, industry or government, academic medicine, or other pursuits.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;School of Nursing&lt;/b&gt; ranks second overall in the nation in the last survey (2015) for both its master's of nursing program and its nursing&#45;midwifery program conducted by US News &amp; World Report in which nursing schools were evaluated. The school provides education and research training in the social, behavioral and biological sciences, with a focus on health, illness and health care. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;School of Pharmacy&lt;/b&gt; ranks No. 1 in the nation for its Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) program in the 2012 survey conducted by US News &amp; World Report that included pharmacy schools. The school teaches students to be lifelong experts in the safe and effective use of medicines and to be effective and vocal members of the health care team. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Graduate Division&lt;/b&gt; oversees educational programs that rank at the top nationally, including seven in the top 10 in the prestigious National Research Council’s 2010 survey. The Graduate Division administers programs that are cross&#45;discipline, cross&#45;department and even cross&#45;school, rather than being based in one department, thereby fostering a culture of collaboration that leads to greater accomplishments.
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cancer.ucsf.edu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cancer&#45;related Patient Care and Research at UCSF&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;UCSF’s long tradition of excellence in cancer research includes the Nobel Prize&#45;winning work of J. Michael Bishop and Harold Varmus (1989), as well as that of Elizabeth Blackburn (2009). Bishop and Varmus discovered cancer&#45;causing oncogenes, opening new doors for exploring genetic abnormalities that cause cancer, and forming the basis for some of the most important cancer research happening today. Dr. Blackburn discovered the molecular nature of telomeres and the role of the telomerase enzyme. In addition to numerous other established cancer researchers at UCSF, Alan Ashworth, PhD was recently appointed the new director of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cancer.ucsf.edu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center&lt;/a&gt;. Dr Ashworth identified the BRCA2 gene and was the first to recognize the role of PARP inhibitors in treating BRCA&#45;1 and BRCA&#45;2 related cancers. As the president of the organization, he is committed to bringing together &lt;a href=&quot;http://cancer.ucsf.edu/about/directors&#45;welcome&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;scientists and clinicians&lt;/a&gt; from many disciplines to collaborate on virtually every aspect of cancer – understanding the basic biology, identifying risk factors and finding the best ways to control or prevent the disease. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A commitment to successful research programs in basic research, clinical research, and cancer prevention and control, as well an emphasis on patient care, community service, and outreach related to cancer, are the basis for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cancer.ucsf.edu/about/about&#45;us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. The only National Cancer Institute (NCI) designated comprehensive cancer center in the Bay Area, comprehensive status is the NCI's highest ranking, and is awarded after a rigorous evaluation process which shows that the center pursues scientific excellence and has the capability to integrate diverse research approaches to cancer. The UCSF Bakar Cancer Hospital is a unique new hospital (open 2/2015) that is part of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ucsfmissionbayhospitals.org/cancer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center&lt;/a&gt; and located steps away from a world&#45;class research center, thus bringing top researchers and clinicians side by side. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cancer.ucsf.edu/about/facts&#45;figures&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cancer&#45;related research and clinical care&lt;/a&gt; are priorities for UCSF. Approximately one&#45;quarter of the university’s full&#45;time faculty members work in cancer research or patient care.  Research within the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer center is linked to research performed throughout the entire UCSF community. Furthermore, translational research within the Cancer Center is supported by resources and infrastructure provided by the CTSI. The Cancer Center’s more than 370 members and associate members — faculty investigators in laboratory, clinical, and population&#45;based research — exemplify the value of attacking the cancer problem through collaborative, interdisciplinary research.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://cancer.ucsf.edu/people&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cancer Center members&lt;/a&gt; represent dozens of departments and institutes in the UCSF Schools of Medicine, Pharmacy, Dentistry, and Nursing. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Members exemplify extraordinary scientific distinction as measured by &lt;a href=&quot;http://cancer.ucsf.edu/about/facts&#45;figures&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;prestigious national and international honors&lt;/a&gt;.  Among the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center’s members are Drs. Bishop and Blackburn, as well as three winners of the Albert Lasker Award for Basic or Clinical Medical Research; eight Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigators; 13 members of the National Academy of Sciences; 20 members of the Institute of Medicine; 18 Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; and four Fellows of the Royal Society and the Royal Society of Edinburgh.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h3&gt;Biomedical Research at UCSF and Beyond &lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Leading biomedical research universities, such as UCSF, are engines of discovery that launch new ideas into the private sector for &lt;a href=&quot;http://cancer.ucsf.edu/about/facts&#45;figures&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;development&lt;/a&gt;. An estimated 90 life&#45;science startup companies have been spawned from the university’s labs. Overall, the University of California system has received more patents than any other university in the world, and UCSF is ranked first in the system for active patents. Among UCSF patents are many of the system’s top revenue producers, including hepatitis B vaccine; yeast expression vector, a technique for delivering medicines to the body’s cells; a form of recombinant DNA used for the production of therapeutic agents; and magnetic resonance imaging.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Public&#45;private partnerships can speed the advancement of biomedical research and move discoveries from bench to bedside. UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center investigators have developed creative partnerships with dozens of life&#45;science companies in the Bay Area and beyond. Current initiatives, totaling millions of dollars in research funding, include strategic partnerships with Novartis, Genentech, SurroMed, Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Celera Diagnostics and Predicant Biosciences.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://qb3.org/about/organization&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;QB3&lt;/a&gt; was established in 2000 as a partnership between research facilities at UC Berkeley, UC Santa Cruz, and UCSF, QB3 provides educational initiatives and training in quantitative biosciences. Research in quantitative biosciences often requires large equipment such as MRI scanners, genome sequencers or supercomputers, which are too expensive for a single lab to acquire. QB3’s campus directors keep current with the needs of their faculty, purchasing major equipment and hiring staff to ensure essential facilities are available for all. A fourth division, the Innolab, based in the
			&lt;p&gt;QB3 director’s office, helps researchers commercialize scientific discoveries and supports the Bay Area’s commercial life&#45;science ecosystem. QB3 promotes cross&#45;campus, interdisciplinary research Creative partnerships with industry and support for entrepreneurial scientists bring the fruit of research to market and bring benefit to society—in the form of products, services, and high&#45;value life science jobs. QB3’s tools include research facilities, educational programs, internships, mentoring, incubators, and a seed&#45;stage venture fund.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The Entrepreneurship Center at UCSF provides the knowledge, support and connections needed by our community of scientists and clinicians who want to commercialize their inventions through a startup. &lt;a href=&quot;https://ita.ucsf.edu/entrepreneurship&#45;center&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Center&lt;/a&gt; provides courses, programs and a network to expose investigators to the entrepreneurial mindset and the Silicon Valley ecosystem that is the world's standard. We support entrepreneurial interests in all areas of life science/healthcare, whether therapeutics, research tools, medical devices, diagnostics, digital health or Big Data.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The Division of Hematology and Oncology at the University of California San Francisco offers specialized training for physicians interested in adult hematologic malignancies and blood and marrow transplantation (BMT). This intensive one&#45;year fellowship is designed to prepare physicians for academic careers in hematologic malignancies and transplantation. Our transplant program is very active, with over 190 transplants performed annually and 10 departmental faculty members capable of serving as clinical preceptors and research mentors. Active clinical and translational research programs cover a board range of topics including the development of novel conditioning regimens, hematopoiesis, leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma biology, graft vs. host disease, and immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h2&gt;Goals &amp; Objectives:&lt;/h2&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Preparation for successful career in hematologic malignancies and blood and marrow transplantation (BMT) in an academic setting.

			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To improve medical knowledge, and overall subspecialty competence related to the areas of Hematology and Oncology.
			&lt;/ul&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;There is no board certification in BMT. ACGME Guidelines do not apply to this fellowship&#45;training program. Graduates of this fellowship will receive recognition of the additional hematologic malignancy and BMT training from UCSF, a FACT&#45;accredited institution. FACT is the Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapies.

			&lt;/p&gt;


			&lt;h2&gt;Basic Curriculum&lt;/h2&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;Clinical &amp; Research Components&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The Hematologic Malignancy/BMT fellowship is a one year program and the fellow will participate in all activities of the Hematologic Malignancy/BMT group. An outline of the typical rotation schedule follows; it can be tailored slightly to fit specific career interests.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Inpatient BMT – 4 Months&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Time spent in clinical Hematologic Malignancy/BMT service will focus on the fellow acquiring experience in the diagnosis and treatment of hematologic malignancies, preparative therapy for transplantation, blood and marrow harvesting, peripheral stem cell and blood marrow infusions, management of acute and chronic GVHD and supportive care of the transplanted patient. The fellow is expected to take night phone calls on a rotational basis with another fellow during this inpatient time.
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;


			&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Outpatient BMT – 6 Months&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Time spent in the outpatient clinic will focus on BMT patients pre and post transplant as well as the management of graft&#45;versus host disease and the general approach to the outpatient management of various hematologic malignancies. This will include attendance at the bi&#45;weekly unrelated&#45;donor and umbilical cord selection meeting. During the outpatient rotation, experience will be gained on the Transplant Infectious Disease service, Radiation Oncology clinic, the BMT clinical laboratory, and the Tissue Typing laboratory.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Research – 2 Months&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fellows are expected to conduct clinical or laboratory&#45;based research during the year of the fellowship training in an area of interest in hematologic malignancy and/or BMT.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meetings&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fellows are expected to attend the annual American Society of Blood and Marrow Transplant Tandem meeting and/or the annual American Society of Hematology meetings. Other meetings, such as ASCO, will be on an ad hoc basis. Supervision and patient care responsibilities The non&#45;ACGME Hematologic Malignancy/BMT fellow will be supervised by an attending when seeing patients. The fellow will be responsible for follow&#45;up on transplant patient related issues, such as changes in immunosuppression. Fellows will participate in informed consent conferences and in weekly Transplant Rounds for discussion of new and pending BMT candidates. Fellows will interact with the hematology malignancy/BMT clinic practice nurses regarding phone calls and urgent problems related to transplant patients.

			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;To improve medical knowledge, and overall subspecialty competence related to the areas of Hematology and Oncology.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;There is no board certification in BMT. ACGME Guidelines do not apply to this fellowship&#45;training program. Graduates of this fellowship will receive recognition of the additional hematologic malignancy and BMT training from UCSF, a FACT&#45;accredited institution. FACT is the Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

											&lt;p&gt;It has always been enormously moving to have patients and their families express their gratitude for the care they receive during a difficult time. That gratitude can come in many forms &#45; a kind word, an offer to volunteer, or a financial gift &#45; but regardless of the form it takes, it all contributes to our ability to extend and expand a tradition of outstanding patient care and groundbreaking research.&lt;/p&gt;
										&lt;p&gt;If you have questions about giving to the Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, please email Melanie Ranen at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:mranen@support.ucsf.edu&quot;&gt;mranen@support.ucsf.edu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The Division of Hematology  &amp;amp; Medical Oncology oversees a significant research program, in which we study and create novel treatments for blood disorders, diseases of the blood&#45;forming organs, and cancer. Our goal is to reduce the risk of these disorders around the world and to improve the life of each patient through basic, clinical, and translational research.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Researchers from our division enjoy substantial support from the National Institutes of Health, including Special Programs of Research Excellence (SPORE) grants for breast cancer. In addition, many of our faculty members have appointments at and/or work closely with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cancer.ucsf.edu/research/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center&lt;/a&gt; the only center in Northern California to receive the prestigious designation of “comprehensive” from the National Cancer Institute. The center ranks first in California and sixth nationwide in National Cancer Institute research grants. &lt;/p&gt;
